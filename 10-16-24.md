# Network Device Management
## Syslog
* Logging messages on Cisco devices comply with the Syslog standard
* a Syslog message is generated when something happens on the device, such as an interface going down, or an OSPF neighbor adjacency coming up
### Syslog Format
* the format of the messages is: seq no:time stamp: %facility-severity-MNEMONIC:description
* ex: `*Oct 3 00:44:12.627: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to administratively down`
* in this message, the sequence number is n/a, the time is Oct 3 00:44:12.627, the facility is LINK, the severity is 5, and the mnemonic is CHANGED
### Syslog Severity Levels
* 0 Emergency - System is unusable. a panic condition
* 1 Alert - A condition that should be corrected immediately, such as a corrupted system database
* 2 Critical - Critical conditions, such as hard device errors
* 3 Error - error conditions
* 4 Warning - Warning conditions
* 5 Notice - Normal but significant conditions. not errors, but may require special handling
* 6 Informational - Informational messages
* 7 Debug - Messages that contain information normally of use only when debugging a program
### Logging Locations
* Syslog messages can be logged to various locations:
    * Console Line - events will be shown in the CLI when you are logged in over a console connection. All events logged by default
    * VTY Terminal Lines - events will be shown in the CLI when you are logged in over telnet or SSH. not enabled by default
    * the logging buffer - events saved in RAM memory, you can view them with the `show logging` command. all events logged by default
    * External Syslog servers
* You can specify the same or different severity levels to log for each location
* All messages of that severity level and higher will be logged
* for example, if you set a logging level of 3 for the console, events with severity levels 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be logged there
* if you set a logging level of 7 for an external Syslog server, events from all severity levels 0-7 will be logged there
* `no logging console` disables logging to the console line
* `logging monitor 6` will log events 6 or higher on VTY lines
* `logging buffered debugging` logs all events to buffer
### Logging to an External Syslog Server
* You can log to an external Syslog server to centralize event reporting
* you will typically set verbose logging to provide detailed troubleshooting information
* `logging <ip addr>`
* `logging trap <level>`, usually 7/debugging
### SIEM Security Information and Event Management
* a basic Syslog server provides a centralized location for Syslog logging messages.
* A SIEM system provides a centralized location for all logging messages and will typically provide advanced analysis and correlation of events
* `show logging` to view buffer
### Logging Synchronous
* when working in a CLI session, by default any syslog messages will be printed into the middle of any commands you are currently typing
* `line <line>`
* `logging synchronous`
### Debug and Terminal Monitor
* Show and Debug commands can be used to view specific information over and above the standard Syslog messages
* `show` shows a static point in time state
* `debug` dynamically updates in real time
* be careful with debug commands in some production environments, a large amount of output can overwhelm the device
* debug output is logged by defualt to the console and buffer
* use the `terminal monitor` command to enabel debug output to the VTY lines
## SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol
* SNMP is an open standard for network monitoring
* an SNMP manager (server) can collect and organize information from an SNMP Agent, which is the software that runs on managed devices such as routers and switches
* SNMP servers may also be called NMS (Network Management System)
* the SNMP manager can pull information from the device (Get) or the device can push it to the server (Trap)
* for example, the Manager could query traffic statistics from the device, or the device could report an HSRP state change
* the standard also supports modifying agent information from the SNMP manager to change device behavior.
### MIB - Management Information Base
* Data variables on SNMP managed systems are organized into an MIB
* the SNMP manager and agent need to share the MIB so they know which variables can be reported on
### SNMP Versions
* Three significant versions of SNMP
* SNMPv1 uses plain text authentication
* SNMPv2c also uses plain text Community strings. supports bulk retrieval
* SNMPv3 supports strong authentication and encryption. It is the preferred version, but not supported on all devices.
### SNMPv2c Community Strings
* uses Community Strings rather than a username and password to authenticate
* matching community strings need to be set on both sides for hte manager and agent to communicate
* the read only (ro) community is used by the Manager to read information
* the read write (rw) community is used by the Manager to set information
### Configuration Example
* `snmp-server contact <string>`
* `snmp-server location <string>`
* `snmp-server community <string> ro`
* `snmp-server community <string>> rw`
* `snmp-server host <addr> <community string>`
* `snmp-server enable traps config` notifies server whenever global configuration is entered
### SNMP Security Best Practice
* Most devices use a default ro Community string of 'public' and a default rw Community string of 'private'
* Attackers can use this to read or set information on your devices
* best practice is to disable SNMP on devices where it is not used
* use SNMPv3 with secure passwords on devices where it is used
* if SNMPv3 is not supported, use non-default community strings
## SNMPv3 Configuration
* the SNMP Manager and Agent recognize each other through simple unencrypted community strings in SNMP v1 and v2c
* SNMPv3 supports authentication and encryption
* the SNMPv3 security model works with users and groups
* a matching user account is set up on the NMS server and network device
* settings are derived from the group the user is a member of
### SNMPv3 Security Levels
* 3 different security levels, configured at the group level
* noAuthnoPriv - no authentication password, and communications are not encrypted. username acts as a replacement for the community string
* AuthNoPriv - Password authentication is used (securely), no encryption is used for other communications
* AuthPriv - Password authentication is sued, and all communications are encrypted.
### Group Configuration
* `snmp-server group <name> v3 auth/noauth/priv (access/context/match/notify/read/write)`
* Access can be used to reference an access-list which limits the device to communicating with the IP address of the NMS server only
* Contexts are used on switches to specify which VLANs are accessible via SNMP
* Views can be used to limit what information is accessible to the NMS server
* if you don't specify a write read view, then ALL MIB objects are accessible to read
* if you don't specify a write group, then NO MIB objects are accessible to write
* the NMS server gets read only access to all MIBs by default
* the notify view is used to send notifications to members of the group. if you don't specify any, then it will be disabled by default
### User Configuration
* `snmp-server user <username> <group> v3 auth md5/sha AUTHPASSWORD priv des/3des/aes 128/192/256 PRIVPASSWORD`
* SHA and AES most secure, but a little slower
### Syslog vs SNMP
* Both Syslog and SNMP provide logging functionality
* Syslog can often provide more granular detail than SNMP, but it has support for the device pushing information only (not pulling or setting from the server)
* NMS servers will typically support both Syslog and SNMP
### NMS vs SIEM
* there is some overlap between NMS and SIEM products. both can gatehr logging information from network infrastructure devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls using protocols such as Syslog, SNMP, and NetFlow
* products marketed as NMS will have a focus on collating network information and provide reports, early warning of and easier troubleshooting of network events
* a product which is marketed as a SIEM will have a focus on collating security information and provide reports, early warning of and easier troubleshooting of security events
# Quality of Service
## Overview
* historically, phones and networking would be completely separate systems
* in the modern day, both (and video) use the same underlying network
* this enables cost savings and advanced features for voice and video
* however, data, voice, and video are now fighting for the same shared bandwidth
### Quality Requirements for Voice and Video
* Voice and traditional standard definition video packets must meet these recommended requirements to be an acceptable quality call:
    * latency < 150 ms
    * Jitter (variation in latency) < 30 ms
    * loss < 1%
* these are one way requirements, meaning a packet sent from a phone in HQ has 150 ms to reach a phone in the branch, and vice versa
* HD video has stricter requirements
### FIFO - First In First Out
* Whenever congestion is experienced on a router or switch, packets are sent in a FIFO manner by default
* Congestion can be experienced whenever it is possible for packets to come in quicker than they can be sent out
### Congestion Example
* Traffic is going left to right from the HQ to the Branch
* the WAN edge router has a FastEthernet interface on the inside LAN and an E1 interface on the outside WAN interface
* Traffic destined for the branch comes in on the LAN interface at a rate lower than 2 mbps
* whenever packets are queued up, they are congested
* the size of the queue changing causes jitter
* if a packet arrives when the queue is full, the router is going to drop it
* voice and video calls will be of unacceptable quality if they do not meet their delay, jitter, and loss requirements
### Mitigating Congestion
* add more bandwidth (this costs money)
* use Quality of Service techniques to give better service to the traffic that needs it
* with QoS Queueing, the voice packets are prioritized over the data packets
* this minimizes delay
### Effects of QoS Queueing
* QoS queuing can reduce latency, jitter, and loss for particular traffic
* the original driver for Qos was Voice over IP, but it can be used to give better service to data applications
* if you're prioritizing one type of traffic to give it better service, the other traffic types must get worse service
* the point is to give each type of traffic the service it requires
* QoS queueing is not a magic bullet, and is designed to mitigate temporary periods of congestion. if a link is permaenently congested, the bandwidth should be increased.
## Classification and Marking
* for a router or switch to prioritize a particular type of traffic, it has to recognize that traffic first
* common ways to recognize the traffic are by Class of Service, Differentiated Service Code Point, Access Control lists, or Network Based Application Recognition
### CoS Class of Service
* Layer 2 Marking
* 3 bit field in the 802.1q frame header which is used t ocarry the CoS QoS marking
* values range from 0-7, default is 0 (best effort)
* CoS 6 and 7 are reserved for network use
* IP phones mark their call signaling traffic as CoS 3 and their voice payload as CoS 5
### DSCP - Differentiated Services Code Point
* Layer 3 Marking
* ToS type of service byte is used to carry the DSCP
* 6 bits are used, 64 possible values
* default is 0 (best effort)
* IP phones mark their call signaling traffic as 24 (CS3), and their voice payload as 46 (EF)
* standard markings for other traffic types, such as 26 (AF31) for mission critical data, and 34 (AF41) for standard definition video
### The Trust Boundary
* the switch should be configured to trust markings from the IP phone and pass them on unchanged, but mark traffic from the PC down to CoS 0 and DSCP 0
### Quality Requirements for Voice and Video
* Voice and video endpoints mark their own traffic with a DSCP value
* if you want to give a particular quality of service to another application, the endpoints will typically be unable to mark their own traffic
* Access Control Lists can be used to recognize traffic based on its layer 3 and layer 4 information
* for example, SSH traffic going to and from the router 10.10.100.10 on TCP port number 22
* NBAR (Network Based Application Recognition) can be used to recognize traffic based on layer 3 to layer 7 information
* signatures can be downloaded from Cisco and loaded on your router which recognize well known applications
### Preferred Methods
* DSCP is the preferred classification and marketing method, because the router can very quickly gather information from a single byte in the IP header
* if using another method, such as an ACL, or NBAR, this should be done as close to the source as possible, and then a DSCP value added

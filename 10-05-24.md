# IPv6
## Why we need IPv6
### Problems with NAT
* NAT breaks the end-to-end IP model
* this can cause issues with security and with some applications
* 10.0.0.10 > 10.0.0.100 "call extension 11-2001"
* CallManager-A dial plan: 11-xxxx is available at 203.0.113.20
* Router A NATs source address 10.0.0.100 to 203.0.113.3
* router B NATs destination address 203.0.113.20 to 10.0.10.100
* 10.0.10.100 > 10.0.10.10 "call for you, please ring"
* 10.0.10.10 > 10.0.10.100 "user picked up, ready for call"
* 10.0.10.100 > 203.0.113.3 "ext 11-2001 is ready for the call at 10.0.10.10"
* router B NATs 10.0.10.100 to 203.0.113.20
* router A NATs the destination 203.0.113.3 to 10.0.0.100
* CallManager-A to phone A: "stream voice to 10.0.10.10"
* CallManager-B to phone B: "stream voice to 10.0.0.10"
* the phones only have connectivity to each other on their NAT'd public IP addresses, not via internal private addresses, and so the call fails
### NAT Problem
* Devices such as application-layer firewalls, traversal servers, and proxy servers can help with these issues
* it would be a cleaner solution if IP supported an addressing scheme which was big enough to give all devices in the world a publicly reachable address
* Enter IPv6, where a 128 bit address spaces provides orders of magnitude more addresses than IPv4
* 7.9 * 10 ^ 28
### IPv6 Enhancements
* in addition to the larger address space, IPv6 was designed to support built-in security and host mobility
### Dual Stack
* IPv4 and IPv6 does not have to be an 'either or' decision
* in a dual stack implementation, a network interface can have both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address at the same time
* it can communicate using either protocol
* dual stack can be enabled long term to support both IPv4 and IPv6 applications, or shorter term if being used as an IPv4 to IPv6 transition strategy
## The IPv6 Address Format
* uses a 128 bit address
* address is written as X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X, where X is a 16 bit hexadecimal field
* e.g. 2001:0DB8:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001
### IPv6 Address Part Naming
* IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, written x.x.x.x
* each 8-bit segment is called an octet
* IPv6 addresses have 16 bit segments, but don't have an official name
* sometimes called 'hextets' 'pieces' or 'quartets'
### Address Shortening
* The IPv6 address is very long. there are a couple ways we can shorten it to make things more convenient
* Address shortening is a standard convention and supported by all vendor's devices
* Leading zeros in each field can be removed
* 2001:0DB8:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001 can be written as 2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:1
* successive all zero fields can be shortened to ::
* 2001:DB8:0:1:0:0:0:1 can be written as 2001:DB8:0:1::1
* successive all zero fields can be shortened only once in an address to avoid ambiguity
* 2001:0:0:1:0;0:0:B can be either 2001::1:0:0:0:B OR 2001:0:0:1::B
* it can't be shortened to 2001::1::B as this is ambiguous
## IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses
* IPv6 has three types of special addresses
* Global Unicast
* Unique Local
* Link Local
*global unicast addresses are similar to IPv4 public addresses
*they are assigned to an individual host and have global reachability (unless they are blocked by security policy, such as on a firewall)
* they are assigned from the range 2000::/3
* internet authorities assign blocks from the overall 2000::/3 range to organizations
* a common assignment for a company is a /48 block, eg 2001:10:10::/48
* a smaller or larger size block can be assigned depending on the size of the company
* IPv6 standards state that addresses assigned to individual hosts should use a /64 mask
* the IPv6 address is 128 bits, so /64 splits it in half for the network and host portions of the address
* if a company is assigned a /48 address by the internet authorities and uses /64 addresses, that leaves 16 bits the company can assign to its internal subnets
* for example, if the company was assigned 2001:10:10::/48 by the internet authorities, it can assign subnets 2001:10:10:0::/64 to 2001:10:10:FFFF/64 for its internal network segments
* 16 bits = 65,536 possible subnets
* 64 bits left over = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 hosts per subnet
### Example
* in this example, the company has been assigned 2001:DB8:0::/48 by the internet authorities
* using a /64 for all network subnets including point to point links and loopback addresses can seem wasteful, but the official declaration is that the IPv6 address space is so large that it does not create a problem
* using /64 everywhere simplifies the addressing, and enables the use of EUI-64 addresses
## IPv6 Configuration
### Broadcast and Multicast
* IPv4 supports broadcast to all hosts on 255.255.255.255
* routers do not forward broadcast traffic so this stays on the local subnet
* IPv6 does not support broadcast traffic
* it does however support multicast to all hosts on the local subnet (ff02::1), which is functionally the same
* many services which use broadcast to 255.255.255.255 in IPv4 use more specific multicast addresses in IPv6 (eg ff05::1:3 for all DHCP servers)
### Configuration
* at global config, `ipv6 unicast-routing`
* on the interfaces, `ipv6 addr 2001:db8:0:1::1/64` to add an address
* generally, commands that would be `ip` for ipv4 use `ipv6` for IPv6
## EUI-64 Addresses
* A cisco router can generate full IPv6 addresses for itself when given the interface and /64 network to use
* the host portion of the address is derived from the interface's MAC address, which is guaranteed to be globally unique
* a MAC address is a /48 address, compared to the /64 host portion of the IPv6 address
* FF:FE is injected in the middle of the /48 MAC address to bring it up to 64 bits. Also, the 7th bit is inverted
### EUI-64 address configuration
* on the interface config, `ipv6 address <subnet portion>/64 eui-64`
* `show interface f0/0` gets "Hardware is DEC21140, address is ca01.2f24.0000"
* `show interface f2/0` gets "Hardware is DEC21140, address is ca01.2f24.0038"
* `sh ipv6 interface brief` shows:
* FastEthernet 0/0 [up/up]
    2001:DB8:0:1:C801:2FFF:FE24:0
* FastEthernet2/0 [up/up]
    2001:DB8::C801:2FFF:FE24:38
* the router will borrow the MAC address from the first ethernet port for non-ethernet interfaces such as Serial ports
* it is not recommended to use EUI-64 on your router interfaces. It is better to use a memorable address such as 2001:db8:0:1::1
* it is, however, useful for end hosts
## Unique Local and Link Local Addresses
### Unique Local Addresses
* Unique Local Addresses are similar to IPv4 RFC 1918 private addresses
* they are not publicly reachable
* they are assigned from the range FC00::/7
* hosts should be assigned /64 addresses
### Link Local Addresses
* Link local addresses are valid for communications on that link only
* they are assigned from the range FE80::/10-FEB0::/10
* Hosts should be assigned /64 addresses
### Link Local Connectivity
* A, B, and C have connectivity to each other via the FE80::1, FE80::2, and FE80::3 link local addresses on the same segment
* B and D have connectivity to each other via the FE8::4 and FE80::5 link local addresses on the same segment
* FE80::1, FE80::2, and FE80::3 do not have connectivity to FE80::4 or FE80::5
### Link Local Addresses use cases
* can be used for communications which should not be forwarded beyond the local link, such as routing protocol hello packets and updates
* they are mandatory on IPv6 enabled cisco router interfaces
### Assigning Link Local Addresses
* Link Local addresses are automatically generated with EUI-64 addresses on IPv6 enabled Cisco router interfaces
* the EUI-64 address can be overridden with manual configuration
* with `ipv6 unicast-routing`, ports assigned an
* ipv6 address will also have a link local address
* because it is valid only on the local link, you can use the same address on multiple interfaces
### Multiple IPv4 Addresses
* when assigning an additional IPv4 address on an interface, it will override the existing IPv4 address
* to have more than one, `ip addr <addr> <mask> secondary`
* unusual to configure IPv4 addresses
### Multiple IPv6 Addresses
* can have multiple IPv6 addresses on an interface
* in IPv6, adding an additional address will not overwrite but add an additional address
### Summary
* Link local addresses are mandatory on IPv6 enabled interfaces
* Global unicast and Unique local addresses are optional
* You can have multiple addresses on the same interface
* One link local address for routing protocol traffic and one global unicast address for normal routing is typical
## SLAAC: Stateless Address Auto-Configuration
* Hosts can be assigned IPv6 addresses through static addressing, DHCPv6, or SLAAC
* DHCP servers track their MAC address to IP address segments, so this is 'stateful' addressing
* with SLAAC, hosts learn the /64 subnet their interface is on from their local router, and then use this infermation to generate their own IPv6 EUI-64 address
* Modern operating systems randomise the host portion of the address rather than using EUI-64 for privacy reasons
* the router does not track which hosts have which IP address so this is 'stateless' addressing
### Router Advertisements
* When a global unicast IPv6 address is configured on an interface, then Router Advertisements advertising the network prefix are sent out by default
* these ICMP messages are sent to the 'all nodes' multicast address from the interface's link-local address
* hosts can also send a 'router solicitation' message to request the information
* as well ass telling the hosts which subnet to generate their IP address on, the router tells the hosts to use itself as their default gateway
* the original implementation did not support any information other than the default gateway address
* end hosts cannot learn their DNS server from their router over SLAAC
* in practice, a DHCP server is still required to give out information such as DNS server
* if the IP address is assigned by SLAAC and the DNS server is assigned by DHCP, this results in a stateless configuration, where the DHCP server does not retain information about the hosts
### The Unspecified Address
* :: is the Unspecified or Unknown address
* :: an IPv6 route to ::/0 is a default route equivalent to 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 in IPv4
* also, :: is used as the source when an interface is trying to acquire an address
### Neighbor Discovery
* NEighbor Discovery is the IPv6 version of ARP and works in the same way
* rather than doing ARP requests and replies, Neighbor Discovery uses ICMP Neighbor Solicitations and Neighbor Advertisements
* Neighbor Solicitation messages are sent to the Solicited-Node multicast, which reaches all hosts on that subnet
* `show ipv6 neighbors` to verify

# Cisco Operating Systems
* Cisco was originally router company only
* IOS operating system has been used since 1984, day one
* Catalyst switches product line from Crescendo acquisition in 1993
* Original Cisco switch operating system was CatOS, now deprecated
* Firewalls from Network Translation acquisition, Finesse OS
* Both switches and firewalls were ported over to IOS
* Standard for all cisco network devices
* Some newer routers and switches have different operating systems
* IOS still a majority
* Nexus and MDS data center switches run NX-OS
* NCS, CRS, ASR9k and XR12k routers all use IOS-XR
* ASR1k routers use IOS-XE
* CLIs for other operating systems are near-identical to IOS
* mostly different under the hood
* IOS kernel is monolithic, which means any one process can crash the whole platform
* other options have microkernels and run processes in protected address spaces
* IOS still very reliable, other OSes tend to be on higher-end platforms
# Connecting to Cisco Devices over network
* Lab exercises are local simulations
* Lecture shows how to connect to real routers or switches with Putty
* Labs do not need PuTTY
* day to day, you usually won't be interacting with network devices
* most devices will be in another location, either local to that office or on an external network
* uses Secure Shell (SSH)
* Telnet is also supported but insecure and not advisable
* in enterprise environments, login is generally handled with a central Authentication, Authorization, and Acounting server
* SSH and AAA appear in later lectures
* Production network: network used by normal users in their day to day
* don't do this usually!
* use separate management network if it exists (usually)
* dedicated management network gives backup path to reach devices if there are any issues
* also more secure to work over management network
* prod is 'in band', as opposed to 'out of band'
# Making initial connection to a cisco device
* Cisco devices do not usually have a default IP address
* will need to set up one to connect
* need a way to connect for initial configuration
* console connection to the rescue!
* enables direct connection to device at lower level than IP for setup
* console cable (DB9 to 'rj45' [actually 8P8C])
* modern console cables use USB/mini USB
* connect to device using PuTTY over serial (default settings usually okay)
* console connection is useful for troubleshooting
* connect if device is unresponsive
* troubleshoot boot process
* NOT possible over SSH, as device needs to have booted for IP address to be live
# Navigating the Cisco IOS operating system
* '?' shows commands
* 'enter' to scroll through commands line by line, 'space' to scroll page by page
* to enter exec mode, command is 'enable'
* user level shows '>' in terminal, privileged exec mode shows '#' in terminal
* 'en' for short to go back up if needed
* shortcuts are possible but only when unambiguous
* typing a series of characters followed by '?' shows all commands that start with that list of characters
* Ctrl-c breaks from a command
* tab will expand on unique match
* it's a command line
* it does command line things
* you know how to use a command line, you've been doing it since you were 11 years old
* you've written at least a dozen command line applications
* honestly it feels really good to know that so much of this is stuff you already know
* configure terminal with 'configure terminal' or 'conf t'
* Ctrl-a to go back to the start of the line
* 'hostname <name>' can change the device name
* make sure you're at the right command level!
* very common mistake to be at the wrong level
* Levels:
* user level: >
* privileged exec level: #
* global config level: (config)#
* interface config level: (config-if)#
* go up by one level each time
* user -> 'enable' privileged -> 'config t' global config -> 'int <something>' interface config
* enter 'end' to go all the way back down
## common commands
* show ip interface brief
* show running-config
* show run int <interface> shows subset of config
* 'show run | begin hostname' shows config starting from hostname (you know pipes!)
* 'ex' to exclude a string
* 'section' to show a specific section of config
# IOS configuration management
* changes take effect immediately
* in addition to running config, there is also startup config
* this will be in effect whenever the router is started or rebooted
* running config changes DO NOT GET SAVED until copied from running config to starting config
* at privileged level, you can use 'copy run start' to save the running config as a startup config
* 'copy run ?' to show options, one of which is flash memory on the router
* 'copy run tftp' will let you send a config as a file over tftp
* 'more flash:<name>' prints config
* IOS operating system image is on the flash
* startup config is on NVRAM
* running config is stored in RAM

# Access Control Lists - Cont.
## ACL Syntax
### ACL Actions
* deny, permit, or remark
* remarking is good as it allows you to add a note for why that entry exists, since otherwise it may become unnecessary but will not be removed without knowing for sure
### ACL Protocols
* routing protocols, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ESP are all supported
* use TCP or UDP if you want that entry to apply to traffic for a particular application between a source and destination address
* use IP if you want ACE to apply to all traffic between source and destination
### ACL Source
* dotted decimal, any, or host
* `host 10.10.10.10` is the same as `10.10.10.10 0.0.0.0`
* `any` is the same as `0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255`
### Source Port Number
* `eq` to match an exact port
* `gt` to match any port number above
* `lt` matches any port less than the given port
* `neq` matches only packets not on a given port number
* `range` matches any port in the range
### Destination Address
* same format as the source address
### Final Options
* additional options are available after entering the destination address, such as destination port, TCP flags, and logging.
* the `log` keyword is not required to log hit counts. it is commonly used to log to the console, or to an external monitoring server
* `show access-lists <number>` to view a given ACL and the hit counts for each rule
## ACL Operations
### Access Groups
* ACLs are applied at the interface level with the Access-Group command
* ACLs can be applied in the inbound *or* outbound direction
* you can have a maximum of one ACL per interface, per direction
* you can have both an inbound and an outbound ACL on the same interface, but not 2 inbound or outbound ACLs
* an interface can have no ACL applied, an inbound ACL only, an outbound ACL only, or ACLs in both directions
### Access-Group configuration
* done on the interface level
* `ip access-group <number> <out/in>`
### Verification
* `show ip interface <number> | include access list`
### Access Control Entry Order
* the ACL is read by the device from top to bottom
* as soon as a rule matches, that is what is used and the list is not processed any further
* ***ordering is important!***
* ```access-list 1 deny host 10.10.10.10
    access-list 1 permit 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255``` will deny 10.10.10.10 but permit the rest of the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet
* in the other order, it will NOT block 10.10.10.10
### Injecting ACEs into an existing ACL
* ACEs are automatically numbered in increments of 10
* this allows you to inject a rule into an existing ACL
* Support for injecting ACEs into an existing ACL started with Named ACLs but is also supported in numbered ACLs now
* `ip access-list extended <number` will go into a submenu that allows modifying the list
* `<line number> ...` will insert a new ACE. note you do not need to add access-list or the list number
### Implicit Deny All
* there is an implicity `deny any any` rule at the bottom of ACLs
* if an ACL is not applied to an interface, all traffic is allowed
* if an ACL is applied, all traffic is denied except what is explicitly allowed
### Explicit Deny All
* many organizations include an explicit deny all at the end of ACLs to log illegal traffic
* `access-list <num> deny any log`
### Explicit Permit All
* if an ACL is applied, all traffic is denied except what is explicitly allowed
* if you want to reverse this so that all traffic is permitted except what is explicitly denied, add a permit all statement to the end of the ACL
* `access-list <num> permit any`
### Traffic Sourced from Router
* ACLs applied to an interface do not apply to traffic which originates from the router itself
* the hosts on the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet cannot Telnet to R2
* an administrator can Telnet to R2 from the CLI on R1
# Network Address Translation
* exists because of the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space
* additionally useful for security reasons, as it allows for a boundary between public and private IP addresses
* will be covering static and dynamic NAT
* static NAT is generally for end hosts which receive incoming traffic from the internet, while dynamic NAT is used for end hosts that need to send outgoing traffic only
* Port Address Translation allows multiple hosts on the inside to use the same public IP address on the outside
## IPv4 Address Exhaustion and NAT
* The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documents standards with RFCs (Requests For Comments)
* RFC 1918 specifies private IP address ranges which are not routable on the public internet
* private addresses were originally designed for hosts which should have no internet connectivity
* public IP addresses cost money, and if an organization has a part of a network where the hosts need to communicate over IP but do not require internet connectivity, they can assign private IP addresses
* each class has its own range of private addresses:
    * class A uses 10.0.0.0/8
    * class B uses 172.16.0.0/12
    * class C uses 192.168.0.0/16
### IPv4 Global Address Space Problem
* the designers of IPv4 did not envision the explosive growth of its use
* 4.3 billion addresses seemed more than enough
* the protocol is not particularly efficient in its use of the available space, with many addresses being wasted
### IPv6
* The internet authorities started to predict address exhaustion in the late 80's, and IPv6 was developed in the 90's as a long-term solution
* IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses, compared to IPv4's 32 bit address
* IPv6 provides nearly 8 * 10 ^ 28 times as many addresses as IPv4
### IPv6 problem and NAT
* no seamless migration path from IPv4 to IPv6
* NAT was implemented as a temporary workaround to mitigate the lack of IPv4 addresses until organizations had time to migrate to IPv6
* has turned out to be far more permanent than expected
* an organization can use private IP addresses on their inside network, but still grant their hosts internet access by translating them to their outside public IP address
* many hosts on the inside can share few or even a single public IP address on the outside
### Today's Networks
* Many industry experts predicted in the early 2000's that IPv6 would be ubiquitous within a few years
* it hasn't worked out that way - most enterprises today use RFC 1918 IPv4 addresses with NAT
* RFC 1918 has the security benefit of hiding inside hosts by default, plus network engineers have more experience with IPv4 than IPv6
## Static NAT
* Permanent one-to-one mapping usually between a public and private IP address. used for servers which must accept incoming connections.
### Static NAT Scenario
* we have bought the range of public IP addresses 203.0.113.0/28 from our service provider
* 203.0.113.2 is used on the outside interface of our network
* 203.0113.1 is used as the default gateway address
* 203.0.113.3-203.0.113.14 remain available
* Int-S1 at 10.0.1.10 is an internal web server which needs to accept incoming connections from the internet
* we need to assign a fixed public IP dadress to accept incoming connections. we will use the first available address, 203.0.113.3
* a static NAT translation is required to translate the public IP address into the private IP address
* the translation is bidirectional, so it will also translate 10.0.1.10 to 203.0.113.3
### Static NAT Configuration
* on the external interface, `ip nat outside`
* on the internal interface, `ip nat inside`
* under global config, `ip nat inside source static 10.0.1.10 203.0.113.3` will set up the static NAT for our server Int-S1
* for verification, `show ip nat translation`
## NAT Translations - Inside/Outside Local/Global
* Inside Local address - IP address actually configured on the inside host's OS
* Inside Global address - Network Address Translated address of the inside host as it will be reached outside the network
* Outside Local - Address of the outside host as it appears to the inside network
* Outside Global - the IP address assigned to the host on the outside network by the host's owner
### Outside Local vs Outside Global
* router R1 in our example knows one address to reach the outside host (203.0.113.20)
* for one way NAT, the outside local and outside global addresses will always be the same
### Two Way NAT
* not required for the CCNA exam, but demonstrative for understanding Outside Local vs Outside Global
* used if you have a merger between two companies
* long-term, the ideal solution is IP readdressing across the network
* for the short-term, two-way NAT can make this work
* with two-way NAT, the address is changed for both the source and destination addresses
* when sending traffic from A1 to B1, it will translate the source address from 10.10.10.10 to 10.10.20.10, and also the destination address from 10.10.30.10 to 10.10.10.10
* in the real world, two-way NAT is very rare and hopefully temporary
* in this scenario, these are the addresses:
    * Inside Local: 10.10.10.10
    * Inside Global: 10.10.20.10
    * Outside Local: 10.10.30.10
    * Outside Global: 10.10.10.10
## Dynamic NAT
* uses a pool of public addresses which are given out on an as-needed, first come first served basis. usually used for internal hosts that do not accept incoming connections, but still need access to the internet.
### Dynamic NAT Scenario
* we have bought the range of public IP addresses 203.0.113.0/28 from our service provider
* 203.0.113.2 is used on the outside interface of our network
* 203.0113.1 is used as the default gateway address
* 203.0.113.3 is being used for a static NAT translation for the 10.0.1.10 web server
* 203.0.113.4-203.0.113.14 remain available
* the hosts in the 10.0.2.0/24 network do not accept incoming connections so they don't need a fixed public IP address with a static NAT translation
* they do need outbound connectivity, so they do need NAT
* we will use the remaining addresses 203.0.113.4-14 as a NAT pool
* the inside hosts will be translated to the public IP addresses on a first come first basis when they send traffic out
* the first host to send traffic out will be translated to 203.0.113.4, the second to 203.0.113.5, etc. up until the end of the pool at 203.0.113.14
* with standard dynamic NAT you need a public IP address for every inside host which needs to communicate with the outside
* if you have 30 hosts, you need 30 public IP addresses
* when all the addresses in the pool have been used, new outbound connections from the other inside hosts will fail because there will be no addresses left to translate them to
* these hosts would have to wait for existing connections to be torn down and the translations to be released back into the pool when they time out
### Configuration
* in global config: `ip nat pool <name> <low addr> <high addr> netmask <mask>`
* create an access list that references the internal IP addresses we want to translate
* associate the two with `ip nat inside source list <number> pool <name>`
* make sure that the relevant ports are configured as outside or inside!
* still verify with `show ip nat translation`
### `clear ip nat translation`
* can be used to remove translations from the translation table
* useful when troubleshooting
* often required if you want to edit your NAT configuration, since the router will not allow changes when there are active translations
* `clear ip nat translation *` will remove all dynamic translations
* `show ip nat statistics` can be useful too
## PAT Port Address Translation
* Allows the same IP address to be reused
### Dynamic NAT address exhaustion
* standard dynamic NAT translates inside hosts to public IP addresses on a first come first served basis
* this requires a public IP address for every inside host which communicates with the outside network
* When all the addresses in this pool have been used, no outbound connections from other inside hosts will fail because there will be no addresses left to translate them to
### Port Address Translation
* Port Address Translation is an extension to NAT that permits multiple devices to be mapped to a single public IP address
* with PAt you do not need a public IP address for every inside host
* the router tracks translations by IP address and layer 4 port number
* because the different inside hosts are assigned to different port numbers, the router knows which host to send return traffic to, even when the public IP address is the same
### Dynamic NAT with Overload
* Dynamic NAT with Overload uses PAT to allow more clients to be translated than IP addresses are available in the NAT pool
* if the NAT pool is 203.0.113.4 to 203.0.113.6 for example, the first two hosts will initiate outbound connections with 203.0.113.4 and 203.0.113.5
* the third host will be translated to 203.0.113.6 and the router will track which source port number was used in the translation table
* the 4th and 5th, etc. hosts will also be translated to 203.0.113.6 but with different ports
* when return traffic is sent back, the router checks the destination port number to see which host to forward it to
### PAT Configuration
* add `overload` at the end of the final command for Dynamic NAT
* `ip nat inside source list <number> pool <name> overload`
### PAT with single IP Address
* the last NAT scenario is to cover a small office which has not purchased a range of public IP addresses
* in this case, the outside interface will most likely get its IP address via DHCP from the service provider
* PAT can be used to allow multiple inside hosts to share the single outside public IP address
* the configuration is very similar to dynamic NAT with overload, but translates to the outside interface address rather than a pool of addresses
* `ip address dhcp` `ip nat outside` on the outside port
* `ip nat inside source list <number> <interface> overload`

# Switch Security Mechanisms
## DHCP Snooping
* Rogue DHCP servers may lead to connectivity issues
* to mitigate this, we can use DHCP Snooping
* enabled with `ip dhcp snooping`
* DHCP server responses are dropped if they don't arrive on a trusted port from the switch
* set a trusted interface with `ip dhcp snooping trust` on that interface's configuration
## Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
* used to avoid MITM ARP spoofing
* When you enable DHCP snooping, the switch inspects the DHCP traffic and keeps track of which IP addresses were assigned to which MAC addresses
* for instance, PC1 with MAC address 1.1.1 was assigned IP address 10.10.10.10
* if invalid ARP traffic tries to patch through the switch, the switch drops the traffic
* DAI needs DHCP Snooping to function
* `ip arp inspection trust` on the interfaces for static clients
* `ip arp inspection vlan <number>`
## 802.1X Identity Based Networking
* When 802.1X is enabled, only authentication traffic is allowed on switch ports until the host and user are authenticated
* when the user has entered a valid username and password, the switch port transitions to a normal access port on the relevant VLAN
* end host is the Supplicant
* access layer switch is the Authenticator
* a server on the network is the Authentication Server
## Port Security
* best practice is to administratively shut down unused switch ports
* this stops somebody getting access to the network if they physically connect to the port
* Port Security enables an administrator to specify which MAC address/addresses can send traffic to an individual switch port.
* This can be used to lock a port down to a particular host or hosts
* easy to spoof a mac address, so locking ports down to a specific host is not usually port security's main role in production networks
* port security can also configure individual switch ports to allow only a specified number of source MAC addresses to send traffic into the port
* it can learn connected MAC addresses
* prevents users from adding wireless access points or other shared devices
* at the interface level, `switchport port-security`
### Default Behavior
* only one MAC address is allowed to transmit on the port
* the current MAC address can be disconnected and replaced. the port is not locked down to a particular MAC address
* if a shared device is connected and multiple hosts try to transmit, the port will be shut down
* `show port-security interface <interface>`
### Security Violation Actions
* three options:
* shutdown (default): err-disabled state and block all traffic
* protect: traffic from unauthorized addresses is dropped. allowed addresses are forwarded
* restrict: like protect, but unauthorized traffic is logged.
* to change: `switchport port-security violation <type>` on interface
### Error-Disabled interfaces
* if the violation action is shutdown and a violation occurs, the port will move into an error-disabled state
* to bring it back into service, remove the host with the offending MAC address, and manually shutdown then no shutdown the interface
### Auto Recovery
* you can bring disabled ports into service automatically after they have been disabled for a configurable amount of time (in seconds)
* `errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation` then `errdisable recovery interval <seconds>`
## Locking ports to hosts
* When port security is enabled, the maximum number of MAC addresses allowed to send traffic into the interface is one by default
* this can be increased if multiple hosts share the port, for example an IP phone with a PC plugged into the back of it
* `switchport port-security maximum <number`
* if you have thousands of hosts connected to a network, you can use sticky MAC addresses
* `switchport port-security mac-address sticky` will add the learned MAC addresses to the running configuration
* you can also statically assign the mac address this way by providing a mac address
# Access Control Lists
* identifies traffic going through a router, and the router can then take actions on that information
* traditionally used for securing traffic running through the router
* can be used to block traffic between two subnets, if desired
* not only used for securing traffic
* used to enforce most software policies
* primarily looking at it from the point of view of security in this section
* ACLs can be unintuitive, so there are a few gotchas that will be explained
## Overview
* an ACL identifies traffic based on characteristics of the packet, such as source IP, destination IP, and port number
* the router or switch can take an action based on the result of the ACL
* ACLs are supported on both routers and switches, but both will be called 'routers' in this section
### ACLS for Security
* Original use of ACLs was security, to decide whether traffic should be allowed to pass
* by default a router allows all traffic to pass through its interfaces
* when ACLs are applied, the router identifies traffic and then decides if it will be allowed or not
### ACLS for other purposes
* used for other software policies when the traffic has to be identified
* identify traffic to give better service in a Quality of Service policy
* identify traffic to translate the IP address in a Network Address Translation policy
### ACE Access Control Entries
* Access Control Lists are made up of Access Control Entries that each provide a series of permit or deny rules
* each is written on a separate line
* `access-list 100 deny tcp 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255 gt 49151 10.10.20.1 0.0.0.0 eq 23`
* access-list followed by number, action, protocol, source IP, wildcard, qualifier, port, dest IP, wildcard, qualifier, and port
## Standard, Extended, and Named ACLs
### Syntax
* standard list: 1-99
* extended list: 100-199
* standard ACLs reference the source address only
* extended ACLs check based on the protocol, source address, destination address, and port number
* cisco has extended the ranges
* standard now includes 1300-1999, and extended includes 2000-2699
### Standard lists
* `access-list 1 deny 10.10.10.10 0.0.0.0` is a standard access list
* default wildmask for a standard ACL is 0.0.0.0, meaning a specific address
* the above could be as simple as `access-list 1 deny 10.10.10.10`
* don't forget the wildcard mask when creating rules for IP subnets!
### Extended lists
* `access-list 100 deny tcp 10.10.10.10 0.0.0.0 gt 49151 10.10.50.0 0.0.0.0 eq 23` is an extended access list
* denies tcp traffic from 10.10.10.10 with port greater than 49151 to 10.10.50.10's port 23
* no default wildcard mask for extended ACLs
### Named lists
* you can now reference ACLs by number or by name
* named ACLS begin with `ip access-list` instead of `access-list`
* `ip access-list standard/extended` opens a new config, which allows you to write entries in a submenu

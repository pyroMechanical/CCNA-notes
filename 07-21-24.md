# OSI Layer 1 (Physical)
* OSI layer 1 conveys the bit stream itself
* could be electrical impulse over copper cables, light over fiber optic, or radio signals over the air
* hardware means of sending or receiving data
* defines cables, physical ports
* Focus on Ethernet
* Ethernet can be carried over coaxial (deprecated) twisted pair, fiber, or wireless
* Copper UTP cables are commonly used to connect desktop computers to switches
* Connector type is RJ-45, max length 100 meters
* straight-through cables are used for connecting end devices like PCs to a switch or router
* crossover cables can directly connect two devices of the same type
* modern switches support Auto MDI-X where the receive and transmit signals are reconfigured automatically
### Fiber Optic
* Fiber optic cables support longer distances or higher bandwidth
* may be used to connect multiple buildings in a campus
* also used for switch-to-switch connections
* single mode vs multi mode
* single mode has higher bandwidth and longer distance, but costs more
### Fiber Connectors
* varies a lot, depending on distance and fiber type
* fiber connectors usually go into transceivers which themselves connect to the device
### Power over Ethernet
* Convenient way to get power to devices like IP phones and wireless access points
* only some switches support PoE
* can also use power injectors to provide PoE from a standard switch
# Cisco Device Functions
### Hubs and Switches
* Hubs and switches perform similar functions
* end hosts are connected to hubs or switches
* end hosts can then communicate over the hub or switch
* hubs operate in half-duplex mode
* attached hosts cannot send and receive data at the same time, they can do one or the other
* all hosts share the same collision domain, only one device can transmit at a time
* if two hosts send at the same time, a collision occurs
* hosts use Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
* switches can be either full-duplex or half-duplex (almost always full-duplex)
* attached hosts can both send and receive data in full duplex
* all hosts have their own dedicated collision domain
* no collision detection required
* Hubs are not MAC address aware
* frames are flooded to all ports apart from the one it was received on
* all attached hosts must process all packets on a hub
* switches operate at layer 2 and are MAC address aware
* switches will look at MAC addresses and store that in a table
* if a unicast frame is received where a known MAC address is the destination, it will only send the frame to that port
* better performance and security
* whenever an unknown address is sent, it will be broadcast on all ports aside from the one it was received on.
* switches used to be very expensive, but now are so cheap hubs are no longer available for purchase.
### Routers
* Routers knowh the paths of different IP subnets on a network
* required to send traffic from one subnet to another
* operate at Layer 3 of OSI
* (also at layer 2 and 1, and usually are aware of the entire stack)
* Routers can route between different networks
* Switches can only work on different hosts on a local area network
* routers support various interfaces
* switches typically only support ethernet
* switches forward broadcast, routers do not (by default)
* routers have far fewer ports than switches generally
* when on the same subnet, there's no need to have a router
* different subnets *will* need a router
* advanced switches that are layer 3 aware are often called layer 3 switches
* still more like a switch than a router, but is able to route traffic between different subnets
### Other Cisco Devices
* ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewalls
* IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
* Wireless LAN controllers
* Wireless Access Points
* Unified Communications Manager
* UCS (Unified Computing System)
* Nexus Switches
# Life of a Packet
### DNS (Domain Name System)
* at layer 3, the sending device needs to know the IP address to put it in a packet
* DNS resolves a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) into an IP address
* example would be www.cisco.com
* enterprises typically have an internal DNS server for the IP addresses of internal hosts
* if the internal DNS can't resolve a query, it will forward it out to public DNS servers on the internet
* DNS requests are sent using UDP on port 53, but can fail over to TCP
### DNS on Cisco routers
* to set up as DNS client:
    ip domain-lookup
    ip name-server (DNS server address)
    ip domain-name (primary domain)
    ip domain-list (additional DNS suffixes to search)
* additional DNS server commands:
    ip dns server
    ip host (hostname) (IP address)
* not commonly used on a cisco router, usually you want a full computer (windows/linux) for that
### ARP Address Resolution Protocol
* the sender needs to know the receiver's IP address and MAC address to form the packet it's sending
* we can point the sender directly at the destination IP address or at a user friendly FQDN
* DNS maintains a mapping of FQDNs to IP addresses
* ARP Address Resolution Protocol is used to map the IP Address to MAC address
* sending device will send an ARP request at layer 2, broadcasting on MAC FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
### ARP for Routed Traffic
* when the sender and receiver are on different IP subnets, the traffic must be forwarded by Router
* when the sender can tell that the receiver isn't on the same subnet, it sends a request for its default gateway

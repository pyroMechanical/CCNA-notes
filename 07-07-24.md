# OSI Layer 4 - Transport, TCP, and UDP
* transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between hosts
* responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control
* may or may not do error correction
* flow control is the process of adjusting the flow of data to ensure the receiving host can handle it.
### Session Multiplexing
* Process by which hosts can support multiple sessions simultaneously
* Also allows handling multiple traffic streams simultaneously over one link
* can send different traffic over different or the same ports to different receivers
* tracks and controls different sessions on a given host
### Port numbers
* Layer 4 destination port numbers are used to identify the upper layer protocol
* HTTP uses port 80, SMTP uses port 25
* sender also adds a source port number to the header
* combination of source and destination port can be used to track sessions
* when receiver sends traffic back, it swaps destination and source ports to keep stateful connections
### TCP
* Transport Control Protocol
* one of the two most common protocols
* connection oriented
* when connection is established, data is bidirectional
* uses sequencing to ensure segments are processed in the correct order
* reliable, acknowledgements are sent back and lost segments are resent
* performs flow control
* Three-way handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK
### TCP Header
source port: 16 bits
destination port: 16 bits
sequence number: 32 bits
acknowledgement number: 32 bits
header length: 4 bits
reserved: 6 bits
code bits: 6 bits
window: 16 bits
checksum: 16 bits
urgent: 16 bits
options: 0 or 32 bits
data...
header is 20 bytes without optional portion
### UDP
* User Datagram Protocol
* makes its best effort to send packets
* hopes for the best
* no order sequencing
* not reliable, no acknowledgement sent
* no flow control
* error recovery is up to the upper layers to provide
### UDP Header
soure port: 16 bits
destination port: 16 bits
length: 16 bits
checksum: 16 bits
data...
header is 8 bytes
### TCP vs UDP
* up to application developers
* TCP works best for reliable traffic
* real-time applications like voice and video use UDP as they cannot afford delays
* some applications use both
### Common applications and ports
* TCP ports:
    * FTP (21)
    * SSH (22)
    * Telnet (23)
    * HTTP (80)
    * HTTPS (443)
* UDP ports:
    * TFTP (69) Trivial File Transfer Protocol
    * SNMP (161) Simple Network Management Protocol
* Both:
    * DNS (53)
# OSI Layer 3 - Network, IP
* responsible for routing packets to their destination
* Quality of Service
* Internet Protocol (IP) is the best known layer 3 protocol
* IPv4 is the focus of this section
* connectionless protocol
* no acknowledgements at layer 3
* ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and IPSec also exist
* ICMP used for ping
* IPSec for encrypted communications
* IP most well known by far
### IP Addressing
* logical addressing scheme
* implemented at layer 3
* partitions the overall network into smaller sub-networks
* improves performance and security
* makes troubleshooting easier
* layer 2 MAC addresses are a flat addressing scheme, with no logical separation between networks
### IP Header
* version: 4 bits
* header length: 4 bits
* type of service: 8 bits, used for Quality of Service
* total length in bytes: 16 bits
* ID: 16 bits
* flags: 3 bits,
* fragment offset: 13 bits, used for split packets that are larger than the transmission size
* time to live: 8 bits, decremented by one for each router, if hits 0 then packet is dropped
* protocol: 8 bits, layer 4 information
* header checksum: 16 bits
* source IP address: 32 bits
* destination IP address: 32 bits
* Header options: 0-40 **bytes**

# Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast traffic
* 3 main types of IP traffic
* unicast (single destination)
* broadcast (all hosts on subnet)
* multicast (multiple interested hosts)
* unicast is like a single wire, one copy is sent from the source and one arrives at a single destination
* broadcast is sent once and then to everything across the switch
* routers do not forward broadcast traffic
* multicast sends one copy to different hosts, and can be sent through routers
* multicast is targeted, broadcast is not
# Converting from decimal to binary
* IP addresses are displayed in a decimal format
* more useful to think of the binary bits
# IPv4 Addresses
* written as 4 'octets' in dotted decimal format
* 32 bits long
* 192.168.10.15 is an example
* octets are 8 bits long
* addresses are usually set manually on servers, printers, and network devices
* assigned automatically through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol on desktop computers
* way fewer servers and routers than computers
# Calculating an IPv4 address
* each octet ranges from 0 to 255
* 192.168.10.15 is 11000000.10101000.00001010.00001111
# Subnet mask
* a host can send traffic directly to another host on the same subnet via switches
* to send traffic to a host on a different subnet, it must be forwarded by a router
* the host therefore needs to understand if the destination is on the same or a different subnet
* subnet mask is used for this
* subnet mask is also 32 bits, and written in dotted or slash notation
* a host's IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion
* subnet mask defines the boundary
* example: address 192.168.10.15, subnet mask 255.255.255.0
* we write the IP address out in binary notation, and the subnet mask underneath
* a 1 in the subnet mask indicates the bit is part of the network address
* a 0 is part of the host address
* subnet mask always has contiguous 1's
* in the example above, the network address is 192.168.10
* host address portion is .15
* if sending to 192.168.11.x, that is a different subnet and must go via router
* 192.168.10.x is the same subnet
* host portion is available to be allocated, with two exceptions
* host portion must be unique on that subnet
* do not need to be numbered sequentially
* one could have address 10.10.10.10, and another have 10.10.10.20
* could not have two addresses 10.10.10.10, as that would be a duplicate
* network devices wouldn't know which to send it to
* all 0's in the host portion designate the network address and cannot be allocated to a host
* in the above example, 192.168.10.0
* all 1's in the host portion designates the directed broadcast address
* traffic to the directed address is sent to all hosts on that subnet
* this leaves 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.254 available
# Slash notation
* because subnet mask is always contiguous 1's, it will be 1 to 32 bits long counting from left to right
* allows us to right the subnet mask in slash notation which is more convenient
* 192.168.10.15 / 24 for example address
* network address is 192.168.10.0 /24
* 10.10.10.15 / 255.0.0.0 is 10.10.10.15 / 8
* network address is 10.0.0.0 /8
# IP Address Classes
* the bigger the host portion of the network, the more hosts we can have
* if the subnet mask is /8, we have 24 bits to allocate
* if it's /24, we only have 8 bits
### How internet addressing was originally meant to work
* global coordination of addressing is performed by IANA
* when a company wants to communicate on the internet, the apply for a range of IP addresses
* if they have 6000 hosts, they ask for a range big enough to cover that, plus room for growth
* they then allocate their addresses to their hosts in various offices
* "This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.‚Äù - Douglas Adams
* IPv4 address space is vastly insufficient for modern needs
* IPv6 is the long term solution, but not universal
* current solution is private addresses with Network Address Translation
* private addresses, NAT, and IPv6 are coming later
* original intent important to understand those
# Class A Addresses
* assigned to networks with very large number of hosts
* class A networks always start with a 0 first bit
* default subnet mask is /8
* valid network addresses go from 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0 /8
* allows 126 networks, and 16 million hosts
* 0.0.0.0 / 8 is reserved, as is 127.0.0.0 /8
* all zeros is 'this network', 127 is loopback
### Subnetting
* obviously having all those hosts in a single logical network would be awful for performance
* they can split their /8 address allocation into smaller subnets and allocate those to different offices and types of hosts
* this is caled subnetting
# Class B Addresses
* originally assigned to medium-to-large networks
* first two bits are always 10
* class B defaults to /16
* valid network addresses range from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
* allows for 16k networks and 65k hosts
* also subnetted in real world environments
# Class C Addresses
* used for small networks
* always starts 110
* default subnet is /24
* valid addresses from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0 /24
* allows for 2 million networks and 254 hosts per network
* could be allocated as is for a real world network, or subnetted into smaller subnets
### Private addresses
* there is also a range of reserved private addresses for each class
* valid to be assigned to hosts but are not routable on the public internet
* originally meant for hosts on a closed private network with no internet connection
* class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
* class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
* class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
* private addresses will be covered in a later lecture
# IP Address Classes D and E
* class A, B, and C include all addresses that are valid to assign to end hosts
* what about range 224.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255?
### Class D
* reserved for multicast addresses
* four high order bits are always 1110
* not allocated to hosts and no default subnet mask
* valid range is 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
### Class E
* experimental and reserved for future use
* four high order bits are always 1111
* valid range is 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
* 255.255.255.255 is the broadcast address for 'this network'

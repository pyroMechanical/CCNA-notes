# Connectivity Troubleshooting
* learn to solve network connectivity issues
* first sign of these is usually user complaints
* useful tools are ping and traceroute
## Basic Connectivity Troubleshooting
### Ping
* Ping uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
* ICMP is part of the TCP/IP suite
* Ping tests two-way connectivity
* successful pings on a cisco router show exclamation points
* if a router does not have a corresponding route or the destination IP address does not respond, you will receive dots
* U means 'unreachable' which means the packets were discarded by a security feature
### Extended Ping
* Scenario: PC1 complains he can't access PC3
* problem is R4 does not have a route to 10.0.1.0/24
* Traffic which originates from a router always uses the IP address on the outgoing interface as the source address
* a ping from R1 to 10.1.2.10 will succeed because R4 has a route to 10.0.0.1
* enter 'ping' and hit enter
* pulls up a wizard to configure the details of the ping
### Traceroute
* Similar to ping, but traces the path across the network
* takes advantage of TTL to map out the network path at each step
* when TTL reaches zero, message gets dropped and device receives a message back
### Other Tools
* shop ip interface brief
* show interface
* show arp - Layer 2
* show mac address-table - Layer 2
* Telnet - Layer 4
* nslookup - DNS
* ping by FQDN - DNS
# RIP and EIGRP Fundamentals
* RIP and EIGRP are expected to be knowledgeable
* OSPF is the main concern of the CCNA exam, but RIP and EIGRP should be understood
* passive interfaces, default route injection, and wildcard masks apply to RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF, and are covered in this section
## RIP, the Routing Information Protocol
* Routing Information Protocol is a Distance Vector routing protocol
* uses hop count as metric
* max hop count is 15
* limited to lab or demo environments
* performs Equal Cost Multi Path for up to 4 paths by default
### RIP 2 vs RIP 1
* RIPv1 is a legacy protocol and is not typically used anymore
* does not send subnet mask information with routing updates so VLSM is not supported.
* v2 supports VLSM
* RIPv1 updates are sent every 30 seconds as broadcast traffic. v2 uses multicast address 224.0.0.9
* v2 supports authentication, v1 does not
### RIPng
* RIP next generation supports IPv6 networks
* not covered by CCNA
### Configuring RIP
* `router rip` to configure
* `version 2` to set v2
* `network <address>` to set up network RIP acts on
### Auto-Summary
* RIP summarizes to the classful boundary by default
* 192.168.10.1/30 will be advertised as 192.168.10.0/24
* 172.16.10.1/30 would be advertised as 172.16.0.0/16
* `no auto-summary` while in `router rip` to disable, as almost never desirable
### Manual Summarization
* Manual summarization gives you control of exactly how you summarize
* the individual summarized routes are not advertised, only their summary route
* must be set up on an interface basis
* in config-router: `interface f1/0` then `ip summary-address rip 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0`
### Verification
* `show ip protocols` shows all protocols running on the router
* `show run | section rip` to view rip specific details
* `show ip route` to view rip discovered routes
* `show ip rip database` to view routes received at all
### Default Route Injection
* default static route for all traffic (such as going to internet) where we don't want to configure a default static route
* can be advertised via rip to all other routers via default route injection
* on internet connected router, enter `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2` `router rip` `default-information originate`
## EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
* an advanced distance vector routing protocol
* supports large networks
* very fast convergence time
* supports bounded updates where network topology change updates are only sent to routers affected by the change
* sent using multicast
### EIGRP Characteristics
* will perform equal cost load balancing on up to 4 paths by default
* can be increased to 16
* can be manually configured to perform unequal cost load balancing
### EIGRP Configuration
* `router eigrp 100`
* 100 in this example is the Autonomous System, meaning an independent administrative domain. EIGRP routers need to have the same autonomous system number to peer with each other.
* the network command uses a wildcard mask which is the inverse of a subnet mask
* subtract each octed in the subnet mask from 255 to calculate the wildcard mask
* subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 equals a wildcard mask of 0.0.255.255
* subnet mask of 255.255.255.252 equals a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.3
* if you do not enter a wildcard mask, the command defaults to using the classful boundary
* 0.255.255.255 for class A
* 0.0.255.255 for class B
* 0.0.0.255 for class C
* the network command `network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255` means:
    * look for interfaces with an IP address that falls within this range
    * enable EIGRP on those interfaces, send out and listen for EIGRP hello messages, and peer with adjacent EIGRP routers.
    * Advertise the network and mask which is configured on those interfaces.
### EIGRP Configuration Example
* `network 10.0.0.0`
* a default class A wildcard of 0.255.255.255 will be used
* all interfaces fall within range of this example
* EIGRP will be enabled on all interfaces and the router will peer with adjacent EIGRP routers
* networks advertised:
    * 10.1.0.0/24
    * 10.0.1.0/24
    * 10.0.2.0/24
    * 10.0.0.0/8 is NOT advertised
* `network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255`
* Interface FE1/0 and FE2/0 fall within this range
* FE0/0 does not
* EIGRP will be enabled on FE1/0 and FE2/0 and the router will peer with adjacent EIGRP routers
* networks advertised:
    * 10.0.1.0/24
    * 10.0.2.0/24
    * 10.1.0.0/24 is NOT advertised
    * 10.0.0.0/16 is NOT advertised
### EIGRP Router ID
* EIGRP routers identify themselves using a router ID which is in the form of an IP address
* this will default to being the highest IP address of any loopback interfaces configured on teh router, or the highest other IP address if a loopback does not exist
* as loopback interfaces never go down, if one exists the router ID will not change
* you can also manually specify a router ID
* best practice is to use a loopback or manually set the router ID
* if a loopback or higher IP address has been configured after EIGRP has been set up, the router ID changes on EIGRP process restart
* to manually specify, in eigrp: `eigrp router-id 2.2.2.2`

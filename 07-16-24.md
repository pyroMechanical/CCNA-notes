# Subnetting
### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
* problem with classful addresses is that companies with more than 254 hosts needs to be assigned class B networks
* much fewer than the 65,534 hosts allocated, so this is very wasteful of global address space
* Classless Inter-Domain Routing was introduced in 1993 to alleviate this problem
* partial solution
* removed fixed /8, /16, and /24 requirements, allows them to be split into smaller networks
* called 'subnetting'
* for instance, 175.10.10.0/20
* companies can now be allocated an address range which more closely matches their needs and does not waste addresses
* another benefit of CIDR is that blocks of networks can be advertised on the internet
* route summarisation
* this allows a single superset of smaller networks to be advertised
* ISPs did not need to advertise all networks reachable through it
* summary routes reduce the size of routing tables and take up less memory
* individual links going down in one ISP do not impact others
* this restricts issues to local parts of the network, and reduces CPU load on devices
### Subnetting Overview
* core knowledge area for networking to understand!
* approach from perspective of intended IPv4 design, where all hosts that can communicate on the internet have a public IP address.
* Private IP addresses will be covered later on
//continued here on july 16
* rather than buying separate address ranges, you could purchase a single range and subnet it into smaller portions
* for example: class C 200.15.10.0/24
* to subnet the network, we need to 'borrow' host bits and add them to the network portion
* network address line always mmoves to the right when we subnet
* further to the right we go, the more subnets we have of that size, but fewer hosts per subnet
* available subnet formula is 2^subnet-bits
* if a class C network has a /28 subnet mask, we've borrowed 4 bits so we have 2^4 = 16 subnets available
* for a class B with /28, we've taken 12 bits, 2^12 = 4096
* hosts on different subnets need to use a router to communicate
* goal of subnetting is to break up a network into different logical portions
* available hosts is (2^host-bits) - 2
* network address and broadcast address cannot be assigned
* a class C network with a /28 subnet has 4 bits left for hosts, or 2^4 - 2 = 14
* a class B network with a /28 subnet *also* has 14
### a quick note on ip subnet-zero
* just like we have to subtract 2 to get the number of valid hosts, back in the day we also had to subtract 2 from networks
* original internet standards did not allow networks to use all zeros or all ones
* there wasn't a practical need for this and it wasted addresses
* ip subnet-zero command overrides the limitation and is enabled by default
* with cisco specifically and for the CCNA, DO NOT subtract 2 from the subnet count!
### Subnetting Class C networks and VLSM
* if we move the line all the way to the right and use /31, we have one bit for host addresses
* borrows 7 bits for the network address
* gives up to 128 subnets, which accomodate 2 hosts each
* but wait, what about the network and broadcast addresses?
* /31 breaks the standard rules of IP addressing
* /31 subnets are supported on cisco routers for point to point links (which have no need for a broadcast address)
* for /30, 2 possible hosts again with a network and broadcast address
* borrows 6 bits for the network address
* gives 64 subnets with 2 hosts each
* /30 and /31 both support 2 hosts per subnet
* /31 supports 128 subnets, /30 only has 64
* /31 is useful for maximizing address space
* /30 is more standard and commonly used
* when needing to support 2 hosts ALWAYS use a /30
* /29 has 6 hosts and 32 subnets
* /28 gives 14 hosts with 16 networks
* /27 gives 30 hosts with 8 subnets
* /26 gives 62 hosts with 4 subnets
* /25 gives 126 hosts with 2 subnets
* Variable Length Subnet Masks
* early routing protocols needed all subnets to be the same size
* modern routing protocols suport Variable Length Subnet Masking
* allows different size subnets according to how many hosts they have
* allows more flexibility and precision to waste fewer addresses
### Subnetting practice questions
* what is the network address, broadcast address, and valid host addresses for the IP address 198.22.45.173/26?
11000110.00010110.00101101.10/101101
network address: 198.22.45.128
broadcast address: 198.22.45.191
valid host addresses: 198.22.45.129-198.22.45.190
subnet mask in dotted decimal is 255.255.255.192
solved perfectly!

### Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM)
* find the largest segment and allocate a suitable subnet size for it
* allocate this subnet at the start of the address space
* repeat
* in the real world, you want a scalable design with room for growth
* in the CCNA exam, do EXACTLY what the question asks, don't worry about best practice!
* example: engineering department question
* each engineering department has 28 hosts
* we have been told the departments will not grow and we need the smallest subnets to maximize address space
* optimal subnet mask is /27 (5 bits leaves 30 valid hosts)

### Subnetting examples
* example class B network: 135.15.0.0/16
* if subnetted into /29, there is 3 bits for host addressing (6 hosts)
* 13 bits for network addresses
* for the address 135.15.10.138/29, what is the network address, broadcast address, and range of valid IP addresses?
* 10001/010
* 135.15.10.136 network address
* 135.15.10.143 broadcast address
* 135.15.10.137-135.15.10.142 IP range

* 60.0.0.0/8
* subnet mask 255/255/255/240
* how many hosts? 14
* how many subnets? 20 bits = 2^20 = 1,048,576
* for the address 60.15.10.75/28, what is the network address, broadcast address, and range of valid IP addresses?
* network: 60.15.10.64
* broadcast: 60.15.10.79
* range: 60.15.10.65-60.15.10.78

* class A 60.0.0.0/8
* if we subnet this into /19 networks, how many subnets do we have, and how many hosts?
* 8190 hosts
* 2048 subnets
* 60.15.10.75/19
* network address:60.15.0.0
* broadcast: 60.15.31.255
* range: 60.15.0.1 to 60.15.31.254
### Private IP Addresses
* RFC 1918 is the current specification
* private IP addresses were originally for hosts that should not be connected to the internet
* public IP addresses cost money
* also increases security
* range for each address class
* 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 for class A or 10.0.0.0/8
* 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 for class B or 172.16.0.0/12
* 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 for class C or 192.168.0.0/16
* designers did not expect the explosive growth of the ipv4 address space
* not efficient in allocating already limited addresses
* enter IPv6
* IPv6 uses 128 bit addresses with ~80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 more space
### IPV6 and NAT
* no seamless migration path from v4 to v6
* NAT was implemented as a temporary workaround to mitigate the lack of IPv4 addresses
* an organization can use private IP addresses on their inside network, but still grant their hosts internet access by translating them to their outside public IP address
* many hosts on the inside can share a few or a single public address on the outside
* RFC1918 has the security benefit of hiding hosts by default, and network engineers have more experience with it
* address format completely different
* IPv6 is used a lot in service provider networks, mobile services, and large countries with late internet adoption
* spare public IPv4 addresses were exhausted in 2011
* subnetting still important; most enterprises will subnet for performance and security reasons
* you also need to be able to troubleshoot IP
* because they have the entire private IP address space to work with, it's common to see /24 subnets for end hosts, /30 for point-to-point, and /32 for loopbacks
* complex VLSM is more common in enterprises which use their public IP addresses on their inside networks and need to maximize their use
### contiguous addresses and route summarisation
* can't summarize if addresses are non-contiguous
* careful planning is key!
# OSI Layer 2: Data-Link
* focus on Ethernet
* Frames are encoded and decoded into bits at layer 2
* error detection and correction can be provided for the physical layer
* ethernet is the layer 2 medium used on Local Area Networks
* Ethernet Header
* 8 byte preamble
* 6 byte destination address
* 6 byte source address
* 2 byte length/ethertype
* 46-1500 bytes of data
* 4 byte FCS
* Ethernet uses 48 bit hex MAC addresses
* first 24 bits is Organizationally Unique Identifier, which uniquely identifies the manufacturer of the ethernet port
* last 24 bits are vendor assigned
* burned in MAC address on every NIC port in the world is globally unique

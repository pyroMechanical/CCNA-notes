# Software Defined Networking
## Software Defined Architecture - Cisco Catalyst Center
### IBN - Intent Based Networking
* IBN builds on software-defined networking to move away from a network of individual devices which are manually managed one-by-one to a controller-led network that is managed as an integrated whole
* it captures business intent and translates it to policies that can be automated and applied consistently across the network
* continuously monitors and adjusts network performance to help assure desired business outcomes
### Cisco Software Defined Architecture
* Catalyst Center
* SD-Access
* SD-WAN
### Catalyst Center
* Catalyst Center (formerly DNA Center) is a cisco SDN controller which is designed to manage enterprise environments - campus, branch, and WAN
* as opposed to the APIC, which manages data center environments with Nexus switches
### Catalyst Center Appliance
* runs as a virtual appliance in the cloud or on-premises, or as a physical appliance on Cisco UCS server hardware
* the underlying operating system is linux
* can be clustered for redundancy
### IBN Example 1
* Example 1: QoS policy roll-out
* the intent: the network policy is first defined, for example providing guaranteed service to voice and video accross network locations
* With traditional networking:
    * Network team researches and plans the implementation, then configures each device individually
    * different network device models require different commands
    * very time consuming, liable to mistakes
* Intent Based Networking:
    * network team creates an application policy in catalyst center specifying voice and video as business relevant applications
    * catalyst center automatically configures the best practice QoS settings on the network devices
    * can reduce total deployment time from months to minutes
### IBN Example 2
* securing traffic flows in the campus
* the intent: users in DeptA and DeptB must have connectivity to other users in their own department, and to company servers. must not have connectivity to users in the other department
* with traditional networking:
    * The network team plans the VLAN, IP subnet, and ACL implementation, then configures each switch individually
    * users are expected to stay plugged in to the same access port. they are assigned a VLAN and IP address based on their physical location
    * this method is very time consuming, liable to mistakes, and does not support mobility
* with Intent Based Networking:
    * the network team creates a Group-Based Access Control Policy in Catalyst Center which specifies the allowed traffic flows
    * users log in from and can move to any physical location on campus
    * they are authenticated by Cisco ISE Identity Services Engine and assigned a Security Group Tag controlling their access
### Catalyst center Features - Network Plug and Play
* Network Plug and Play allows routers, switches, and wireless access points to be deployed in remote offices with zero touch configuration
* the device is physically installed in the remote office and connected to the network
* it discovers Catalyst Center through various methods, including DHCP option 43, or DNS 'pnpserver.domain-name.com'
* it then registers with and downloads its configuration from Catalyst Center
* this ensures consistent configuration of remote office devices with no need for a network engineer onsite
### Assurance
* Assurance guarantees that the infrastructure is doing what you intended it to do
* Catalyst Center receives information from all the network devices and ISE etc.
* reports problems and provides recommended remediation actions
* 'AI Network Analystics' (ew) uses """Artificial Intelligence""" and Machine """Learning""" enhanced capabilities
### Assurance - Peer Comparison
* Compares wireless network quality with comparable size peer networks
* KPIs include Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Radio Throughput and Onboarding Error Source
### API Support
* Everything that can be done through the Catalyst Center GUI can also be done via a northbound REST API
* Catalyst center also supports 'east' and 'west' bound APIs for integration with other services such as reporting and analytics servers
## Cisco SD-Access
### Traditional Access Control Overview
* The traditional way to control access to and traffic flows within a network is with fixed VLANs, IP addresses, and Access Control Lists
* users are expected to always connect to the same physical port where they are assigned an access VLAN and IP subnet
* Access Control Lists control traffic flows between IP subnets
* the configuration can get complex, and each device is configured individually
* this solution does not support user mobility
### SD-Access Software Defined Access
* a newer method of network access control which solves the limitations of the traditional implementation
* traffic flow security is based on user identity, not physical location and IP address
* users log in from and can move to any physical location in the network
* Two components are required for SD-Access:
    * users are authenticated by the ISE Identity Service Engine
    * the security policy (permitted and denied communcation between groups) is configured on the Catalyst Center
### Underlay and Overlay Network
* SD-Access uses an underlay and an overlay network
* an underlay network is the underlying physical network. it provides the underlying physical connections which the overlay network is built on top of.
* an overlay network is a logical topology used to virtually connect devices. it is built over the physical underlay network
* the combination of the two forms the SD-Access 'network fabric'
### Underlay Network
* When SD-Access is deployed into an existing 'brownfield' network, any configuration can be used for the underlying physical network. Links between devices can be layer 2 or layer 3 and any routing protocol can be used
* Catalyst Center can be used to automatically provision the underlay network in new 'greenfield' sites. in this case layer 3 links are used between devices and IS-IS is used as the routing protocol
### Overlay Network
* LISP is used for the Control Plane
* VXLAN is used for the Data Plane
* Cisco TrustSec CTS is used for the policy
* Each technology has been optimized for SD-Access
### Policy Plane - Cisco TrustSec CTS
* Users are authenticated by the ISE Identity Services Engine
* the security policy is configured on Catalyst Center
* suers are allocated an SGT Scalable Group Tag
* Cisco TrustSec secures traffic flows based on the security policy and SGTs
* Standard TrustSec needs end-to-end TrustSec devices, SD-Access uses overlay tunnels so can work with other devices

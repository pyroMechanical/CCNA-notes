# Network Automation
## Configuration Management Tools - Ansible and Terraform
### Configuration Management Tools
* Configuration management systems are designed to make controlling large numbers of devices easy for administrators and operations teams
* They allow you to control many different systems in an automated way from one central location
* Popular options (open source and free, with paid for Enterprise editions available):
    * Ansible
    * Puppet
    * Chef
    * Terraform (free Business Source License)
### Configuration Management Tool Benefits
* can automate the provisioning and development of servers and network devices
* require little knowledge of programming
* have established development practices including version control and testing
### Ansible
* can be run from any machine with python 2 or 3 installed
* agentless - no software plugin on the managed device
* Push model - pushes the configuration to the device
* Communicates via SSH by default
* simpler than most other tools
* originally released in 2012
* ansible **modules** are pre-built python scripts
* many pre-built network modules exist
* ansible **inventory** files define all hosts that will be managed by the control workstation
* ansible **playbooks** are YAML files that outline the instructions it needs to run
* **ansible.cfg** is ansible's default configuration file
### Puppet
* Typically uses an agent on the target devices
* 'Puppet Master' runs on linux server
* pull model, agent checks in every 30 minutes by default
* written in Ruby
* uses proprietary Domain Specific Language rather than YAML
* a 'Manifest' defines the device's properties
* can check configuration consistency
* created in 2005
### Chef
* an agent must be installed on target devices
* pull model
* written in ruby
* terminology is Cook Book > Recipe
* Released in 2009
### Terraform
* Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code IaC software tool from HashiCorp
* administrators provision infrastructure using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON
* primarily designed for public and private cloud, can also work with on-premises platforms
* written in Go, can be installed on linux, windows, or mac
* communicates over REST APIs, NETCONF, SSH, SNMP
* Agentless
* Push Model
* Released in 2014
### Terraform Components
* **Configuration files** define the final desired state using 'resource blocks'. resources are virtual machines, network devices, etc.
* the **State file** provides lifecycle management by tracking the deployed resources.
* **Providers** are plug-ins that interface with platforms such as AWS or IOS-XE, define their available resources, and the API calls to manage them
### How Terraform Works
* Administrator creates the configuration files
* 1) Plan: terraform checks the differences between the current state in the state file, and the desired state in the configuration files, then determines the necessary actions to apply. Administrator checks the actions.
* 2) Apply: actions are executed
* 3) Consolidate: state file is updated
### Configuration Management Tool Support
* Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Terraform were designed primarily for server system administration
* Ansible and Terraform are most suitable for network environments, as they do not require an agent. also simpler to learn and use
* limited support on Cisco devices to run agents
### Ansible vs Terraform
* Terraform's primary focus is as an infrastructure provisioning tool
* uses a 'declarative' approach where the desired state is defined, and the tool takes actions to achieve it
* terraform is lifecycle aware - aware of the state of the environment, and changes that have taken place
* Ansible's primary focus is a configuration tool
* uses a procedural approach with a granular sequence of steps that are followed to reach the desired end result
* not lifecycle aware
### Ansible vs Terraform : Mutable vs Immutable
* a mutable object can be changed after it's created, an immutable object cannot. to make changes to an immutable object, it must be destroyed and replaced with a new version
* ansible is considered mutable, terraform immutable by default
* both tools can conduct mutable operations and have immutable elements
### Ansible vs Terraform (Cont.)
* Can be used together
* you could, for example, use terraform to privision an infrastructure, then call ansible to push configurations to the resources. use ansible for future configuration changes
* could also do the reverse, calling terraform as the first step of an ansible playbook to provision the infrastructure, then continue with configuration from there
## SDN - Software Defined Networking
### Router and Switch Planes
* Data (Forwarding) Plane: Traffic which is forwarded through the device
* Control Plane: Makes decisions about how to forward traffic. Control plane packets such as routing protocol or spanning tree updates are destined to or locally originated on the device itself
* Management Plane: the device is configured and monitored in the management plane. for example, at the CLI through Telnet or SSH, via a Gui using HTTPS, or via SNMP or an API
### Data and Control Plane Separation
* Network infrastructure devices are responsible for their own individual control and data planes in a traditional environment
* Software Defined Networking decouples the data and control planes
* the network infrastructure devices are still responsible for forwarding traffic, but the control plane moves to a centralized SDN controller
* rules for packet handling are sent to the network infrastructure devices from the controller
* the network infrastructure devices query the controller for guidance as needed, and provide it with information about traffic they are handling
### Pure SDN vs Hybrid SDN
* with pure SDN, the control plane runs purely on the SDN controller, and the data plane runs purely on the network devices
* with hybrid SDN, the majority of the control plane intelligence is provided by an SDN controller, but the network devices retain some control plane intelligence
* most implementations use a hybrid SDN
### SDN Architecture
* Application Layer - SDN Business Applications, above the controller, controller communicates with Northbound APIs, typically REST
* Control Layer - SDN Controller (Network Services)
* Infrastructure Layer - Network Devices (Routers, Switches, Access Points, and Firewalls)
* controller controls infrastructure using Southbound APIs (OpenFlow, SNMP, REST, NETCONF, RESTCONF, SSH)
### Cisco SDN Controllers: APIC
* Application Policy Infrastructure Controller
* main component of cisco ACI (Application Centric Infrastructure)
* desigend to manage data center devices with Nexus switches
### Cisco SDN Controllers: Enterprise
* Designed to manage enterprise environments - Campus, branch, and WAN
* Old controllers:
    * APIC-EM Application Policy Infrastructure Controller - Enterprise Module
        * not the same as APIC
    * DNA Center (Digital Network Architecture)
        * upgrade to APIC-EM
    * Catalyst Center
        * rebrand of DNA Center

## Why we have EtherChannel
### Oversubscription
* in the Campus Design model, end hosts connect to Access layer switches, Access switches connect to Distribution layer switches, and those Distribution switches connect to the Core switches, which connect to routers and the WAN
* End hosts provide irregular load, with many sitting idle for the majority of the time
* due to this, you can have fewer uplinks to each layer above the previous, and still maintain acceptable network performance
* this is known as Oversubscription
* a rule of thumb recommendation for this is 20:1 from the access layer to the distribution layer
* 20 PCs connected with 1 Gbps at the access layer would require a single 1Gbps uplink to the distribution layer
* the recommendation is 4:1 for hte distribution to core layer links
* general guidelines, you should check your own network traffic rather than assume this is sufficient
* switches often have dedicated uplink ports with higher bandwidth
* for instance, a 48 port 1Gbps switch with a pair of 10Gbps uplinks
* this can help with the subscription ratio
* 48x 1Gbps clients = 48 Gbps
* 2x 10Gbps uplinks = 20 Gbps
* however, this does become an issue because of Spanning Tree!
### Spanning Tree and Load Balancing
* Spanning tree provides redundancy, but NOT load balancing!
* if a switch has multiple equal cost paths via the same neighbor switch towards the root bridge, it will select the port with the lowest Port ID
### EtherChannel
* Etherchannel groups multiple physical interfaces into a single logical interface
* Spanning tree sees the etherchannel as a single connection, and does not block the ports
* now gives the full bandwidth of both interfaces!
### EtherChannel Load Balancing and Redundancy
* Traffic is load balanced across all the links in the EtherChannel
* if an interface goes down, it will fail over to the remaining links
### NIC Teaming
* NIC Teaming combines multiple physical network cards into a single logical interface
* since the operating system sees it as a single logical interface, it only requires one IP address
### Terminology
* Etherchannel can also be called Port Channels, LAG/Link Aggregation, or a Link Bundle
* NIC teaming can also be called Bonding, NIC balancing, or Link Aggregation
## Etherchannel Load Balancing
* A flow is a communication from a client to a server
* if PC1 opens a web session to Server1, and PC2 opens an FTP session with Server2, we have two flows through the switch
* a single flow is load balanced onto a single port channel interface
* for instance, all packets from pc1 to server1 will go over a single physical interface
* packets from the same flow are not load balanced round robin across all interfaces in the port channel
* we do not load balance the first packet from pc1 to server1 on interface g0/1, and the second on interface g0/2
* round robin load balancing could cause packets to arrive out-of-order
* any single flow receives the bandwidth of a single link in the port channel as its maximum
* that's a maximum of 1Gbps per flow, with the aggregate bandwidth of 4 Gbps available across all flows
* You can think of a port channel as a multi-lane highway. The cars stay in a single lane, but because there are many lanes, the overall traffic gets there quicker (silly example)
* Etherchannel provides redundancy as well as load balancing. if a link fails, the flows will be load balanced to the remaining links
## Etherchannel Protocols and Configuration
### LACP
* Link Aggregation Control Protocol
* Open standard
* Switches on both sides negotiate port channel creation and maintenance
* preferred method
### PAgP
* Port Aggregation Protocol
* Cisco proprietary
* similar to LACP
### Static
* switches do not negotiate, but the settings must still match on both sides.
* use if LACP is not supported on both sides
* all protocols configured with `channel-group` command
### Parameters
* The switches MUST have matching configurations
* member interfaces must have the same settings on both sides
* Speed and duplex, access or trunk, native and allowed VLANs, and Access VLAN on access ports
### LACP Configuration
* interfaces can be Active or Passive
* if switch 1's interfaces are active and switch 2's are passive ,the port channel will come up
* if both are active, the channel comes up
* if both are passive, the channel does NOT come up
* best to configure as Active/Active
* `channel-group 1 mode active`
* `interface port-channel 1` to configure the logical interface
* configure matching settings on the other switch on the other end of the links
### PAgP Configuration
* PAgP interfaces can be either Desirable or Auto
* if one side is Desirable and the other Auto, the port comes up
* if both are auto, it does not
* if both are Desirable, the port comes up
* similar to active/passive
* Desirable/Desirable is best practice
### Verification
* `show etherchannel summary`
* `show spanning-tree vlan`
## Stackwise, VSS, and vPC
* Matching etherchannel settings have to be configured on both sides of the link
* you can configure separate port channels from a switch to redundant upstream switches
* spanning tree will see the port channels as two separate interfaces and block one path if a loop is formed
* this brings us back to the problem of only using half our available physical bandwidth
### Multi-chassis Etherchannel
* Cisco supporrts multi-chassis etherchannel on some switches
* these switches support a shared etherchannel from different switches
* must be configured with matching settings
* spanning tree is still enabled, but it does not detect any loops
* this supports full load balancing and redundancy across all interfaces
### StackWise, VSS, and vPC
* StackWise on selected catalyst switch platforms
* VSS Virtual Switching System on other selected catalyst switches
* vPC Virtual Port Channel on the Nexus switch family
## Layer 3 Etherchannel
* add `no switchport` command on a layer 3 switch in order to make the interface a layer 3 interface
* allows you to add an IP address
* this has implications for network design
* by putting layer 3 links in many places in your network, you are no longer reliant on spanning tree
* spanning tree is a necessary evil, but layer 3 support means you aren't dependent on it
* realistic to do now because layer 3 switches have come down dramatically in price
* this means that links will now be determined via routing protocol rather than spanning tree
* since routing protocols support equal cost load balancing, they will automatically load balance
* one consequence is that the default gateway is no won the access layer switch, rather than the distribution layer switches

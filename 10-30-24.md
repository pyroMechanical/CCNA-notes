## SD-WAN
### Traditional WAN Deployments
* Individual device configuration
* Configuration is not standardized organization wide
* Focus is on link connectivity, not the required performance for applications
* Typically difficult to migrate to another WAN service
### SD-WAN
* Cisco acquired Viptelain 2017 to enahnce their SD-WAN solution, previously called IWAN
* it provides automated setup of WAN connectivity between sites
* monitoring and failover is automated
* traffic flow control is application aware
### SD-WAN Benefits
* automated, standardized setup of connectivity between sites
* transport independent - doesn't matter what WAN link you have
* simplified, centralized, integrated operations
* more flexibility and easier to migrate WAN services
* required, predictable performance for important applications
* integration with the latest cloud and network technologies
* lower cost
### SD-WAN Architecture
* Orchestration: SD-WAN Validator
* Management Plane: SD-WAN Manager
* Control Plane: SD-WAN Controller
* Data Plane: WAN Edge Router
### Data Plane - WAN Edge Routers
* WAN Edge Routers, also known as vEdge routers, run on the data plane
* physical or virtual router
* form an IPsec encrypted data plane between each other
* a site can have 2 WAN Edge routers for redundancy
### Control Plane - SD-WAN Controllers
* SD-WAN Controllers (aka vSmart controllers) run the control plane
* centralized brain of the solution
* run as virtual machines
* distribute policy and forwarding information to the WAN Edge routers inside TLS tunnels
* each WAN Edge router connects to two SD-WAN Controllers for redundancy
### Management Plane - SD-WAN Manager
* aka vManage NMS
* provides management plane GUI
* enables centralized configuration and simplifies changes
* real time alerting
* runs as a virtual machine
* multiple SD-WAN Managers are clustered for redundancy
### Orchestration: SD-WAN Validator
* aka vBond orchestrator
* authenticates all SD-WAN Controllers, Managers, and WAN Edge routers
* enables the WAN Edge routers to discover each other, SD-WAN Managers, and SD-WAN Controllers
* has a public IP address and is deployed in the DMZ
* runs as a virtual machine
* multiple SD-WAN Validators can be deployed with round robin DNS
### ZTP - Zero Touch Provisioning service
* Cloud based shared service hosted by Cisco
* utilized on first boot of WAN Edge router only
* directs it to SD-WAN Validator to orchestrate joining it to the network
### On Premises and Cloud
* SD-WAN Validator, Controller, and Manager can be deployed either on premises or hosted in cloud, with either Cisco or a Cisco partner
* most deployments are in the cloud
### Building the Data Plane
* the SD-WAN Controller directs the WAN Edge routers to build a full mesh (by default) of IPsec VPN tunnels between themselves
* SD-WAN Controller then propagates policy and routing information to the WAN Edge routers with OMP, the Overlay Management Protocol
### BF VPN Tunnel Monitoring
* Bidirection Forwarding Detection packets are sent over all VPN tunnels
* this detects if a tunnel goes down, and also provides latency, jitter, and loss statistics
### Traffic Forwarding Options
* if multiple tunnels are available (eg, MPLS and Internet) traffic can be load balanced over the tunnels
* Active/Active
* Weighted Active/Active
* Application pinning Active/Standby
* Application Aware Routing
### Application Aware Routing
* BFD monitors the latency, jitter, and loss across the VPN tunnels
* you can set minimum requirements for an application with SLA classes
* SD-WAN ensures the application is sent over a link which meets its SLA requirements
* by default, traffic will fall back to another link if no suitable link is available
## Cisco Meraki
* Meraki was acquired by cisco in 2012
* provides simple, secure, cloud managed networking
* management and monitoring is throuh the single pane of glass Meraki Dashboard

# CCNA v1.1
## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Standard automation and programming tools like Ansible, Terraform and Python are very good at the deployment of straightforward predefined, rule-based configuration and monitoring tasks
* For example, pushing an enterprises QoS policies to all its network devices
* this simplifies and speeds up these operations and reduces human error
### Automation Tool Limitations
* not so good at more complex, dynamic tasks
* for instance: learning the normal traffic patterns over an entire network, recognizing anomalies, and automatically taking corrective action
* this is nearly impossible to achieve with static policies and configurations
### Traditional Security System Limitations
* Traditional IPS use signatures to inspect packets, looking for traffic patterns which match known attacks
* this does not secure against new threats or anomalies that do not match the predefined signatures
* traditional IPS systems often do support some anomaly detection, but they are not typically capable of analyzing huge data sets collected over time across entire networks or of predicting future patterns
### Artificial Intelligence Defined
* Artificial Intelligence can help with complex, dynamic network tasks
* Cisco define it as the simulation of human-like intelligence by computers
* its intelligence is capable of pattern recognition, learning, reasoning, discovering meaning, problem solving and self-correction
* General Intelligence where a machine has the overall intelligence is a hypothetical goal. current applications are 'narrow AI' which perform a specific task
* AI is a braod term with many different usages and techniques
### Artificial Intelligence Examples
* Web search
* recommendation systems
* speech interaction
* autonomous vehicles
* game play
* creative tools
* when an applications becomes commonplace enough it is often no longer through of as 'AI'
### Machine Learning Defined
* Machine learning is a subset of AI
* Cisco define it as mathematical and statistical methods that enable machines to mimic intelligent human behavior by learning from data without being explicitly programmed
* can analyze huge data sets, identifying patterns, relationships and anomalies. Can automatically improve its performance as it learns more
### ML Training Approaches
* like a human, to understand the data more fully it must be 'trained'
* Training approaches include:
    * Supervised Learning
    * Unsupervised Learning
    * Semi-supervised Learning
    * Reinforcement Learning
### Supervised Learning
* Supervised ML learns patterns and relationships between input and output data
* for example, given an image of a dog as input, and the text class of 'dog' as output
* the computer is presented with 'labeled data' showing example inputs and outputs
* once this is learned, the computer can map new inputs automatically
* a more complex example is a bank loading a customer dataset containing balances and credit history, and which customers defaulted on which loans
* when new customer information is input, the computer can predict if they are likely to default on a potential loan as the output
### Unsupervised Learning
* Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised machine learning is given unlabeled data and allowed to discover patterns and insights without any explicit guidance or instruction
* infers its own rules to structure the information based on similarities, differences, and patterns
* it can cluster the data based on similarities, create association rules based on frequent if-then patterns, and discard the least relevant information
* a data analyst is still required to validate the outputs. for example, to classify a cluster of images as dogs
* unsupervised learning can be used for network anomaly detection where it discovers patterns that are unusual in a dataset of network traffic statistics
### Semi-supervised Learning
* A small amount of labeled data in addition to unlabeled data may produce an improvement in learning accuracy
### Reinforcement Learning
* data is accumulated trial-and-error
* data is not provided as the learning method
* agent decides what to do to perform a given task and learns from its experience
* after each action an algorithm receives feedback that helps it determine whether the choice it made was correct, neutral, or incorrect
* an example usage of Reinforcement Learning is a chess playing machine. it can play itself to automatically learn the best move for each situation.
### AI and ML in Network Operations
* Machine learning can analyze huge sets of network related data, learn normal network patterns (baselining) and detect anomalies
* Artificial intelligence functions can then report on anomalies and automatically take action on them, prevent future patterns and issues such as upcoming congestion, and recommend optimum settings
### Predictive AI
* predictive AI utilizes algorithms and modeling to analyze past and present data to forcast future events and behaviors
* machine learning is used to understand the data and predict what is likely to occur later
* an example is to determine maintenance cycles and predict early faults in machinery based on past events and environmental factors such as heat and vibration
### Predictive AI in Network Operations
* predictive AI can be used in Network Operations for proactive maintenance and performance optimization
* AI can analyze past and current traffic patterns and anomalies, performance statistics, help tickets, maintenance history, and environmental factors in order to forecast problems such as security issues, congestion, and hardware failures.
* this helps network engineers optimize the network and prevent issues from occuring
### Generative AI
* Generative AI utilizes patterns and relationships learned from past data to create new outputs such as text, video, images, and audio
* supervised learning is typically used for training. the machine is given a set of labeled data and learns to generate similar content
* ChatGPT is a well-known example of Generative AI
* example uses are enhanced chat, search, language translation, creation of marketing content, music, and homework (??? are you serious ???)
### Generative AI in Network Operations
* can be used to generate network traffic pattern simulations. useful to identify potential issues under different conditions and help plan for future upgrades without affecting the real network
* can also create optimized network settings and configurations based on current conditions, for a planned upgrade, or as a solution for an issue
* be careful when creating configurations or asking network questions work general tools such as ChatGPT (no duh?). they are not optimized with network data and susceptible to hallucinations
## Generative AI Models
* Neural networks are based on how the brain works. they contain artificial neurons called nodes which are arranged in a series of layers
* they ahve an input and output layer with hidden layers in between
* the input layer receives data which the neural network needs to analyze
* nodes are interconnected from one layer to another
* each connection between nodes has a weight that signifies its relative importance
* if a node receives a high enough total value of weights from all its inputs then it fires and passes data onto the next layer
* the data transfers through the layers until producing an output
### Deep Learning
* Deep learning is a type of machine learning based on a neural network with at least 2 hidden layers (4 layers minimum)
* the multiple layers can progressively analyze the input more deeply
### Neural Network Training
* the path data takes and the final output is influenced by the weight of connections
* if the wrong output is produced, it must be corrected
* backpropagation is used to signal back through the network that the weights have to be changed
* backpropagation uses a mathematical function to iteratively fine tune the weights of connections until accurate output is consistently produced
### Generative AI Models
* three common models buitl on neural networks are:
    * Transformer Models
    * Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    * Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs)
### Unimodal and Multimodal models
* transformer models typically work with text
* GANs and VAEs typically work with visual data
* the models are not mutually exclusive. an AI system can use multiple models
* Unimodal models take instructions from the same input type as their output
* multimodal models can take input from different sources and generate output in various forms.
### Transformer Models
* a transformer model tracks relationships in sequential data. they learn what is appropriate to come next in sequences
* they use a mathematical self-attention technique to understand the importance of different parts of the sequence and determine context
* they are often used with text but can work with any type of sequential data eg DNA, video
* they typically use massive datasets
* can analyze data unsupervised and with parallel processing so they are acceptably fast to implement
* the transformer architecture is composed of encoder and decoder neural networks
* the encoder is only concerned with the input and is typically used for classification
* the decoder is used for output and is used to generate data, such as a text article or programming code
* the encoder and decoder can be used together for tasks such as text translation
* LLMs are built on Transformers
### NLP - Natural Language Processing and LLMs
* uses a broad range of rule based methods to enable computers to understand and generate language as it is spoken and written.
* focuses on recognizing patterns in language to understand its structure
* tasks include understanding, generating and classifying language, translation, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text
* NLP applications us a comparitively small dataset and a method which is relevant to their specific goal
### LLM - Large Language Model
* like NLP, LLMS also perform complex language processing tasks
* NLP models choose a method relevant to their specific goal, but LLMs use transformer based neural networks built with a huge dataset
* can handle almost any NLP task and are very good at generating humanlike text in response to instructions
* their tasks include chatbots, text summarization, translation, and writing original content such as essays or code
### GPT - Generative Pre-Trained Transformers
* GPTs are a Transformer Based LLM
* GPT-1, -2 etc were developed by OpenAI but all LLMs with the same characteristics can be broadly called GPTs
* ChatGPT from OpenAI is built on its GPT models
* GPT uses a decoder to generate text from a prompt
### Transformers in Network Operations
* provide a prompt to generate device configs
* provide netwokr data and configurations to generate network diagrams
* ask it questions such as to check an error message
* beware of hallucinations when using any AI
### GANs - Generative Adversarial Networks
* with GANs, two deep learning models compete against each other, the generator and descriminator
* the generator learns to create new data such as text, images, audio, or video that resembles the training dataset
* the discriminator learns to distinguish between the generated data and the real data
* the descriminator will typically easily identify early efforts as fake
* as training progresses, the generator will produce data that can fool the discriminator (and humans)
* the discriminator itself also improves with training
* GANs are often used for visual data
### GAN in Network Operations
* can generate network traffic simulations and train AI applications to detect network anomalies and security threats
* the generator creates network traffic simulations
* with training the generator learns to create more realistic simulations, and the discriminator learns to detect if the patterns are fake
* GANs are good at creating network diagrams. they can do this in conjunction with transformer models
### VAE - Variational Auto Encoders
* typically used for images
* an encoder and decoder work in tandem to generate output that is similar to the input
* the encoder compresses the input data, optimizing it to retain only the most important informaton
* the decoder then reconstructs the input from the compressed representation
* the decoder generates content which is optimized for the important information
* reduces less desired characteristics
* good at cleaning noise from images and finding anomalies
* like GANs, VAEs can also be used to detect network anomalies and security threats
* can also be used for network traffic simulations
* GANs are better than VAEs for network diagrams, because they produce more detailed output.
## RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation
### LLM hallucinations
* LLMs are susceptible to hallucination where they generate incorrect output data, for example a router configuration with errors
* General LLM models are very good at generating natural text, but they can fall short when technical knowledge of a topic or up to date information is required
* you may be able to include data such as a running configuration as part of an input prompt, but this is not very scalable
### Ways to Reduce Hallucination
* Build a new model from scratch with relevant dataset
* fine tuning with relevant dataset
* both impractical for keeping data up-to-date
### RAG
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances the accuracy and currentness of an existing LLM by looking up an external database
* can be used by nearly an LLM
* relatively easy to implement with public tools and knowledge bases available
* internal knowledge bases can also be used which remain private
### How RAG Works - Creating the Database
* during preprocessing the knowledge base is split into tokens and chunks and converted to a machine readable numeric 'vector' format
* an embedding model creates a vector database optimized for search and retrieval
* in the background, the embedding model continuously updates the vector database as the knowledge base is updated
### How RAG Works - User Queries
* when users enter a query, the Embedding Modle converts it into numeric format which is compared to the vector database
* matches are retreived and sent to the LLM
* the LLM combines the retreived entries with its own response to create output for the user
### RAG usage in Network Operations
* configuration generation
* troubleshooting
* up-to-date documentation
* predictive maintenance

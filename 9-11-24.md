# Spanning Tree Protocol
## Intro
* Core to both the CCNA and the work a network engineer
* Begin with review of how path selection and loop prevention at layer 3
* Explain the purpose of Spanning Tree
* Cover Terminology
* Cover version differences, and how to verify and configure Spanning Tree
* Align paths that spanning tree takes with HSRP configurations
* Portfast and BPDU Guard
## Layer 3 Path Selection and Loop Prevention (review)
* Layer 3 routing and HSRP control the path selection and provide automatic failover for Layer 3 Connections
* from R1, the paths are:
    * default static route to SP1 (Admin. Dist. of 1): `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.1`
    * Backup default route via R2 (Admin. Dist. of 5): `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.20.2 5`
    * G0/1 is directly connected to 10.10.10.0/24 (AD of 0)
    * backup route to 10.10.10.0/24 via R2 (AD 1): `ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.2`
    * R2 is similar, but with routes to R1 as backup, providing redundancy
* from the PCs, both are interfaced with the Virtual IP address 10.10.10.1
* both R1 and R2 are configured with the 10.10.10.1 Virtual IP address via HSRP
### Routing Loop
* in the event of a loop, if traffic was sent along the loop, it will loop around the routers.
* the IP header has a failsafe for this, the TTL field
* each time a packet passes through a router, the TTL is decremented by 1. when it reaches zero, the packet is dropped
* Dynamic routing protocols have built-in loop prevention mechanisms, and TTL acts as a final failsafe
## Why we have the Spanning Tree Protocol
### Ethernet Path Selection Review
* Layer 2 Ethernet path selection is controlled by the switch's MAC address tables
* in the example, PC1 wants to send traffic to 10.10.10.2 on R1
* without Spanning Tree, PC1 would send an ARP request of 10.10.10.2
* source MAC: 1.1.1, destination MAC: F.F.F
* switch Acc3 learns the MAC address 1.1.1 is available via interface F0/1
* any subsequent traffic for 1.1.1 that reaches Acc3 will be forwarded to F0/1
* switch Acc3 floods the braodcast traffic out all ports apart from the one it was received on
* switch CD1 learns that MAC address 1.1.1 is available via F0/24
* CD2 learns 1.1.1 is available via F0/21
* any subsequent traffic for 1.1.1 will be forwarded out those ports if it reaches CD1 or CD2
* CD1 floods the broadcast traffic out all ports apart from the one received on
* traffic reaches R1, CD2, and Acc4
* R1 responds to the ARP request
* CD1 learns that 2.2.2 is available via G0/1
* CD1 forwards 1.1.1 traffic to F0/24
* Acc3 learns that 2.2.2 is available via F0/24
* end to end path selection now exists in both directions
* at the start, Acc3 sends the broadcast traffic out all ports
* CD1 receives the ARP request and sends it all ports, including towards CD2
* CD2 sends traffic out all ports, including towards Acc3
* Acc3 now loops the traffic around, from Acc3>CD1>CD2
* same loop goes in the other direction! from Acc3>CD2>CD1
* there's also two more loops from CD1>CD2>Acc4 and CD1>Acc4>CD2
* that's four loops!
* the layer 2 ethernet header DOES NOT HAVE A TTL FIELD!
* on layer 2, if you have looping traffic, it will loop forever until you physically unplug something!
* this is from a single ARP request, let alone the traffic that actually goes on a network!
* this is called a boradcast storm
* network will crash because the amount of looping broadcast traffic will rapidly overhwelm the network
### Spanning Tree Protocol
* broadcast storms MUST be avoided at all costs
* spanning tree is used to detect and block any loops on the network
* in the example network, the connection between Acc3 and CD2 is blocked, as well as Acc4 to CD2
* this blocks the two loops in the network example
* the access layer switches can only use half of their physically cabled uplink bandwidth
* spanning tree is a necessary evil because a broadcast storm would be a *far* worse scenario
* Spanning Tree automates failover as well as performing loop prevention
* if an access layer switch's uplink to CD1 fails, the link to CD2 will transition from blocking to forwarding
* Legacy spanning tree can take up to 50 seconds to converge
* spanning tree is necessary, but we would like to minimize our usage of it where we can
## STP Terminology - The Bridge
* Hubs were layer 1 devices which performed the same function as switches - connecting Ethernet LAN hosts
* Hubs did not learn MAC addresses, so they flooded all traffic out all ports apart from the one it was received on
* Switches proide performance and security improvements by only forwarding traffic to known unicast MAC addresses out the relevant port
* early switches were expensive, had very few ports, and were called bridges
* they segmented LANS which were built with hubs
* a Bridge is a layer 2 device and learned the MAC addresses from each domain, and could segment a large collision domain into a handful of smaller collision domains
* bridges are basically switches, but with only a couple of ports (~2)
* a switch is a multi-port bridge
* Spanning Tree was invented back when bridges were in use, so it uses that terminology (the 'root bridge' and 'bridge protocol data units')
## How Spanning Tree Works
* Spanning tree is an industry standard protocol and is enabled by default on all vendor's switches
* switches send bridge protocol data units out all ports when they come online. these are used to detect other switches and potential loops
* the switch will not forward traffic out any port until it is certain it is loop free
### Spanning Tree Port States
* when the port first comes online, it will be in a blocking state and will not forward traffic
* spanning tree will detect if the port forms a potential loop
* if there is no loop, the port will transition to forwarding
* the process can take upwards of 50 seconds
### Bridge ID
* the BDPU contains the switch's Bridge ID which uniquely identifies the switch on the LAN
* the bridge ID is comprised of the switch's unique MAC address, and an administrator defined Bridge Priority Value
* the bridge priority can be set from 0 to 65,535, and defaults to 32,768
### The Root Bridge
* a single root bridge is elected based on the switch's bridge ID values
* the switch with the lowest bridge priority value is preferred
* in the case of a tie, the switch with the lowest MAC address will be selected
* the switches form a loop free forwarding-path tree which leads back to the root bridge
### Spanning Tree Path Cost
* When a switch calculates the best path towards the root bridge, higher bandwidth links are preferred
* two types of cost, short-mode cost or long-mode cost
* short-mode is the original implementation, long-mode is newer and more granular
* in short mode, a 20 gbps interface has a value of 1, and any higher speed will still have the same cost
* long mode works up to 20 tbps
* short-mode is the default, so if you have faster interfaces, you need to enable long mode on all of your switches
* short-mode is stored in a 16 bit value (short)
* long mode is stored in a 32 bit value (long in c)
* if you enable long-mode, do it on all switches
* `show spanning-tree pathcost method`
* `panning-tree pathcost method long/short`
* The spanning tree is built with the Root Bridge at the 'top'
* all switches forward traffic on their best (lowest cost) path to the root Bridge
* higher cost paths (which could potentially form a loop) are blocked
* the lowest cumulative STP cost across all links to reach the root bridge is chosen as a switch's Root Path
* a root path cost is a switch's cumulative cost for a specific path to reach the root bridge
* the root bridge advertises a cost of 0 in its BDPUs
* switches add the cost of the link the BDPU was received on
* lowest cost paths are preferred
* You can manipulate spanning tree paths by changing the cost of the interface
* this is NOT a typical way to do this
* best way to do this is by manipulating the location of the root bridge
* if you did want to do this, `spanning-tree cost <cost>`
### Root Ports
* Each switch's exit niterface on the lowest-cost path to the root bridge is selected as its root port
* each non-root switch has EXACTLY ONE root port, on the lowest cost path to the root bridge (the exit interface)
### Load Balancing
* A spanning tree instance does not do load balancing
* if a switch has multiple equal cost paths towards the root bridge, it will select the neighbor switch with the lowest bridge ID
* if a switch has multiple equal cost paths via the same neighbor switch towards the root bridge, it will select the port with the lowest port ID on the neighbor switch
### Designated Ports
* ports on the neighbor switch opposite the root port are Designated Ports
* root ports point towards the root bridge, designated ports point away from it
* all ports on the root bridge are designated ports
### Root Ports and Designated Ports Forward Traffic
* Root ports and their opposing Designated ports are the most direct paths to and from the root bridge, and transition to a forwarding state
### Other Links
* on the remaining links, the switches determine which of them has the least-cost path to the root
* if they have equal cost paths, then the bridge ID is used as a tiebreaker
* the port connecting this switch to the link is selected as a designated port
### Blocking Ports
* any ports which have not been selected as a root port or designated port pair would potentially form a loop
* these are selected as blocked ports
* network traffic is only sent on Root Port links, all others are blocked
* the way spanning tree decides which ports to block is, a switch blocks non-root ports which receive a better BPDU
* spanning tree only blocks one side of the blocked link
* BPDUs continue to be sent over the link from the designated port (but not the blocked port)
* other traffic cannot use the link
* if a blocked port stops receiving better BDPUs it will unblock and transition to being a designated (forwarding) port
### Root, Designated, and blocking ports
* the easiest way to figure out which ports are root, designated, and blocking:
1. Determine the root bridge first (best bridge ID)
2. All ports on the root bridge are Designated ports
3. determine the root ports on all other switches (lowest cost to root bridge)
4. the ports on the other side of all root ports are designated
5. on links which are left, one port will be blocking
6. determine the blocking port (highest cost path to root, or highest bridge ID if tied)
7. the ports on either side of those links are designated ports

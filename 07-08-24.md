# Subnetting
### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
* problem with classful addresses is that companies with more than 254 hosts needs to be assigned class B networks
* much fewer than the 65,534 hosts allocated, so this is very wasteful of global address space
* Classless Inter-Domain Routing was introduced in 1993 to alleviate this problem
* partial solution
* removed fixed /8, /16, and /24 requirements, allows them to be split into smaller networks
* called 'subnetting'
* for instance, 175.10.10.0/20
* companies can now be allocated an address range which more closely matches their needs and does not waste addresses
* another benefit of CIDR is that blocks of networks can be advertised on the internet
* route summarisation
* this allows a single superset of smaller networks to be advertised
* ISPs did not need to advertise all networks reachable through it
* summary routes reduce the size of routing tables and take up less memory
* individual links going down in one ISP do not impact others
* this restricts issues to local parts of the network, and reduces CPU load on devices
### Subnetting Overview
* core knowledge area for networking to understand!
* approach from perspective of intended IPv4 design, where all hosts that can communicate on the internet have a public IP address.
* Private IP addresses will be covered later on

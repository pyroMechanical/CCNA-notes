# Network Automation
## Benefits of Network Automation and Programmability
### Traditional Network Management
* The traditional way to manage network devices is one at a time using SSH to the command line
* Copying and pasting from a text file is common.
* GUI tools to manage one device at a time have also been available for a long time, but they have typically been slow and inefficient.
### NMS Network Management Systems
* NSM systems such as SolarWinds, CiscoWorks, and Cisco Prime Infrastructure have also been available for a long time
* They use protocols such as SNMP and NetFlow to gather information and report on the state of a network
* SNMP was proposed in 1988
* SNMP can also be used to push configuration to devices but it has limited functionality
* the solutions can be complex to implement and operate
* SNMP also has some security concerns
### Issues with Traditional Network Management
* Configuring one device at a time is time consuming and inefficient
* increases likelihood of typos or other mistakes
* individual edits to multiple devices by separate engineers over time with little version control leads to configuration drift (non-standardized configurations)
* having non-standardized configurations and accessing one device at a time is also inefficient for troubleshooting
### Network Automation
* Automation can be used for:
    * Device configuration
    * Initial device provisioning
    * Software version control
    * Collecting statistics from devices
    * Compliance verification
    * Reports
    * Troubleshooting
### Network Automation Benefits
* Network programmability enables automation which reduces human to machine interaction
* this greatly reduces the chance of human error such as typos
* Modern tools have been built with monitoring, configuration, and troubleshooting in mind
* much more scalable than configuring one device at a time
* network programmability can provide configuration version control
* can also provide software version control
* Troubleshooting is more efficient with a system wide view and correlation between events
* Events and error codes can be acted on programmatically
* improving configuration and troubleshooting efficiency reduces operating expenses (Opex)
### Assurance
* Network Automation can also provide Assurance
* ensures devices have a standardized configuration
* provide reports on and correct any exceptions
* provide correlation between events on different devices
* automatically take corrective action on events and error codes
### Which Automation Method to Use
* There are multiple methods that can be used to automate network management - python sripts, NETCONF, RESTCONF, Ansible, Puppet, SDN, Cisco Catalyst Center, etc.
* Not all methods are supported by all devices
* you should choose the methods which are most suitable for your environment and skills
## Python, Git, GitHub and CI-CD
### Python for Network Programmability
* Relatively easy to learn with many training resources available
* human readable
* open source
* can be installed on all popular operating systems
* easy to find network automation code samples
### Git
* Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code and files
* typically used for software development, but can provide version control for any type of files.
* With most client-server vcs, the code has to be 'checked out' and can only be worked on by one developer at a time
* git is a distributed version control system
* every git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities
* because of this, the code can be worked on by multiple developers at the same time
* organizations typically designate one repository as the master copy
### GitHub
* GitHub is a git repository hosting service which adds many of its own features
* repositories can be public or private
* repositories can be copied between users
* task management tools are available
* control mechanisms provide security and resolve conflicts
### CI/CD
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
* a set of operating principles and practices that enable application development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably
* frequent changes are more efficient than rolling them up into large change windows
* automation of building, testing, and deployment allows this
* the implementation is known as the CI/CD pipeline
* tools such as Jenkins and Travis CI aid management of the pipeline
## Data Serialiation Formats - XML, JSON, and YAML
### Data Serialization
* Data Serialization is the process of converting structured data to a standardized format that allows sharing or storage of the data in a for that allows recovery of its original structure
* it allows transfer of the data between different systems, applications, and programming languages
* XML, JSON, and YAML are human and machine readable, plain text data encoding formats
* data formats are mostly interchangeable
which one to use depends on support in the system it is being used with, and which is easiest for you
### JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
* standardized in 2013
* easier for humans to read and work with than XML
* can be imported directly into JavaScript, which is commonly used on the internet
* white space has no special meaning
* RESTful APIs often use JSON
### JSON Data Types
* Object
* Array
* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Null
### JSON Data Types: Object
* An object is an unordered collection of key/value pairs
* they are surrounded by curly braces `{}`
* Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean, or null)
* keys and values are separated by a colon
* each key/value pair is separated by a comma
### JSON Data Types: Array
* An array is an ordered list of values
* they are surrounded by square brackets `[]`
* values must be a valid JSON data type
### JSON Data Types
* String - stored in double quotes `""` a string of alphanumeric characters
* Number - a normal number such as`0.3` or `5`. not in quotes
* Boolean - true or false. not in quotes
* Null - nothing, no other value is present
### XML - eXtensible Markup Lanugage
* Standardized in 1998
* Widely used across the internet
* XML was designed to describe and transfer data, while HTML is focused on how to display data
* white space has no special meaning in XML
* <key>value</key> contained within object tags
### YAML - ~~Yet Another Markup Language~~ YAML Aint Markup Language
* Often used in python, perl, and ansible
* designed to be easily read by humans
* white space is important
* anything at a common indentation level is considered related at the same level
* starts with `---`
* `key: value` representation
* `-` indicates a list
* ansible playbooks use YAML
## APIs - CRUD, REST, and SOAP
### API - Application Programming Interfaces
* an API is a way for a computer program to communicate directly with another computer program
* typically used to perform CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete)
* two main types of APIs for web services (can run over the internet, typically use HTTP) are SOAP and REST
* NETCONF and RESTCONF are APIs specifically designed to work with network devices
### CRUD
* Create - SQL `INSERT`, HTTP `PUT/POST`
* Read(retrieve) - SQL `SELECT`, HTTP `GET`
* Update(modify) - SQL `UPDATE`, HTTP `PUT/POST/PATCH`
* Delete(destroy) - SQL `DELETE`, HTTP `DELETE`
* HTTP Verbs:
    * Put: update/replace
    * Post: create new
    * Patch: update/modify
### SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
* SOAP is a standard communication protocol system that permits processes using different operating systems like Linux and Windows to communicate
* the transport is typically HTTP(S) and the data is ALWAYS XML
* Because it is a protocol, it has strict standards to adhere to
### REST - REpresentational State Transfer
* REST is an architecture, not a protocol. it gives guidelines for the structure and organization of an API
* supports any transport and data format
* HTTP(S) transport and JSON (or XML) data format are commonly used
* typically has faster performance and is easier to work with than SOAP
### REST Constraints
* Client-server architecture: the client sends a request, the server sends a response
* uniform interface: provides simplicity
* statelessness: no client context is stored on the server between requests.
* Cacheability: responses must define themselves as either cacheable or non-cacheable
* Layered system: any intermediary devices such as load balancers must be transparent to the client and server
* code on demand (optional): servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring executable code
### REST Authentication Types
* No Authentication
* Basic Authentication: username and password in plain text. insecure unless encrypted (over https), does not support granular permissions per user
* API key: uses encrypted tokens, usually created in admin portal. the same user can request tokens with different permissions. the server must check the API key permissions on every client request. usaully have long expiry
* bearer token: basic or API key authenticated user requests encrypted bearer token which is then automatically included in other requests. permissions are embedded in the token so it puts less load on server than API key. token is transferrable to other applications, and usually has a short expiry
### REST Request URL
* Request method must be sent (Get, Post, etc.)
* Headers with key:value pair information about the request can be added (eg. accept:application/json, credentials)
* Post, put, and patch requests include data in the body
* https://demo.flackbox.com|/api/running/aaa/users/niel|?dryrun
* Target Host - demo.flackbox.com
* Resource - /api/running/aaa/users/niel
* Parameters (optional) - ?dryrun
### REST Response Codes
* 1xx: informational
* 2xx: success
* 200: OK
* 201: Created
* 204: No Content (deleted)
* 3xx: Redirection
* 4xx: Client Error
* 400: Bad Request
* 401: Unauthorized
* 403: Forbidden
* 404: Not Found
* 418: I'm A Teapot
* 5xx: Server Error
* 500: Internal Server Error
* responses to Get requests include data in the body
* headers can also be included in the response
## Model Driven Programmability - YANG, NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gRPC
### Data Models
* a well understood and agreed upon method to describe something
### YANG - Yet Another Next Generation
* YANG (IETF, 2010) is a data modelling language which provides a standardized way to represent the operational and configuration data of a network device
* can be used both internally and when packaged for transmission
### Network Management Transport
* The configuration and operational status of a network device's components and services can be remotely read or written to
* NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gRPC are APIs which describe the protocools and methods for transport of network management data
### Model Driven Programmability Stack
* interfaces and features at the bottom
* modules above that, either standard or vendor specific
* modules either describe the configuration or operation of the device
* YANG Data models
* interacting with YANG will use NETCONF, RESTCONF, or gRPC
### NETCONF Communications
* YANG data is encapsulated in XML, which is further encapsulated in NETCONF
### NETCONF and YANG
* NETCONF was designed as a replacement for SNMP
* NETCONF and YANG provide a standardized way to programmatically inspect andm odify the configuration of a network device
* YANG (IETF, 2010) is a data modelling language which provides a standardized way to represent the operational and configuration data of a network device
* NETCONF (IETF, 2006) is a protocol that remotely reads or applies changes to the data on the device
* XML encoding is used
* transport is over SSH or TLS
### NETCONF protocol stack
* Content -data to be inspected or changed: `<data>`
* Operations - eg `<get-config>, <edit-config>`, initiated via RPC methods using XML encoding
* Messages - RPC Remote Procedure Calls (RPC allows one system to request another system to execute code): `<rpc>, <rpc-reply>`
* Transport - between client and server. supports SSH or TLS
### RESTCONF
* standardized in 2017, builds on NETCONF
* IETF draft that describes how to map a YANG specification to a RESTful interface
* uses HTTP verbs over a REST API
* RESTCONF is not intended to replace NETCONF, but is simpler to use
* XML or JSON encoding is used
* transport is HTTP(S)
### gPRC
* Google RPC is an open source remote procedure call system initially developed at google in 2015
* well suited to collecting telemetry statistics
* GPB Google Protocol Buffers encoding is used - (personal note: yikes!)
* transport is HTTP/2
### Postman
* very popular tool to test the operation of REST APIs
* can be downloaded as a standalone app or run as a chrome plugin
* collections and environment variables allow you to easily reuse requests
* requests can be exported as code in multiple programming languages
* cURL in linux or the requests module in python can also be used to test APIs

# Spanning Tree Protocol - cont.
## Spanning Tree Versions
* Spanning tree is an industry standard protocol, and is enabled by default on all vendor's switches
* IEEE Open Standards:
    * 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) - the original implementation. uses one spanning tree for all VLANs in the LAN
    * 802.1w Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) - Significantly improved convergence time. still uses one spanning tree for all VLANs
    * 802.1s Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) - Enables grouping and mapping VLANs onto different spanning tree instances for load balancing
### MSTP load balancing example
* the access layer switches have PCs attached to multiple VLANs
* CD1 is the root bridge for VLANs 10-19
* traffic for those vlans is forwarded on the link to CD1 and blocked on the link to CD2
* CD2 is the root bridge for VLANs 20-29
* traffic for those vlans is forwarded on teh link to CD2
* two spanning tree instances run, one for each group of vlans
### Cisco versions
    * Per VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+) - Cisco enhancement to 802.1D. uses a separate spanning tree instance for every VLAN. this is the default on most cisco switches
    * Rapid per VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (RPVST+) - Cisco enhancement over 802.1w RSTP. Significantly improved convergence time over PVST+. Uses a separate spanning tree instance for every VLAN
* Cisco versions do not support grouping multiple VLANs onto the same instance
* in the example above using PVST/RPVST, there would be twenty instances of spanning tree running, one per vlan
### Cisco supported versions
* most modern cisco switches support PVST+, RPVST+, and MSTP
* PVST+ is the default on most cisco switches
### Spanning Tree Version Configuration
* `spanning-tree mode ?` will show which options are available
* `show spanning-tree summary` shows which mode is active
* `spanning-tree mode mst/pvst/rapid-pvst`
### Spanning Tree 802.1D note
* standard 802.1D-1998 classified the legacy classic Spanning Tree Protocol
* 802.1D-2004 covered RSTP
* when network engineers say 802.1D in describing an STP version, we're referring to the original legacy spanning tree protocol
* other names being 'legacy/classic/original Spanning Tree'
* newer documents have since been published
### Spanning Tree Port Roles
* Blocking ports are termed 'Alternate Ports' in the newer spanning tree versions
* 802.1D STP: Root, Designated, Blocked
* all others: Root, Designated, Alternate
## Verification - `show spanning-tree`
* `show spanning-tree (vlan <number>)?`
* `ieee` is actually PVST+
* Root ID gives information about the root bridge
* Bridge ID gives information about the local switch
* Root ID will say if it is the root
* shows the status of all interfaces connected to other switches
* on the root bridge, all ports will be dedicated and forwarding
* otherwise, it will show the cost to the root and the root port
## Manipulating the Root Bridge Election
* because spanning tree selects paths pointing towards the root bridge, it acts as the center point of the LAN
* best practice is to ensure a pair of high-end core switches are selected as the first and second most preferred root bridge
### The Root Bridge Election
* you can manipulate the election by setting bridge priority
* the default is 32,768, and the lowest number is most preferred
* in the case of a tie, the switch with the lowest MAC address will be selected
* this is likely to be your oldest switch!
### Suboptimal Root Bridge
* All switches are left with the default Bridge Priority in this example
* The switch with the lowest MAC address becomes the root bridge
* this is the old switch in the warehouse
* it has low bandwidth links, and limited CPU and memory
* Traffic from a PC connected to access1 is going to have 7 hops, including through that old switch in the warehouse
* network is likely to be congested, overwhelmed CPU and suboptimal performance
* `spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary` on Core1 would dramatically improve things
* sets a bridge priority of 24576, ensuring that it will be the root bridge
* this will lead to 5 hops instead, along the most direct path through the network
### Root Bridge FAilover
* if core1 fails, we want to ensure traffic still goes through the most direct and centralized path
* configuring core2 with `spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary` will set a bridge priority of 28672, ensuring it is the secondary
* altarnatively, you can use the `spanning-tree vlan <id> priority`
* `priority 24576` will do the same thing as `root primary`
* `priority 28672` will do the same thing as `root secondary`
* valid values for priority are 0 to 61440
* MUST be a multiple of 4096
* setting an exact value provides more granularity than the primary and secondary commands

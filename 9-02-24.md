## OSPF Adjacencies
### OSPF Protocol
* OSPF is protocol 89 in the IP header
* OSPF packet contains:
    * Version number: v2 or v3
    * type: 1 - hello, 2 - DBD, 3 - LSR, 4 - LSU, 5- LSAck
    * router ID, and Area ID: of the router and interface
    * Authentication type: 0 - no password, 1 - plaintext password, 2 - MD5 authentication
### Hello packets
* OSPF routers discover each other and form adjacencies via Hello packets
* Hello packets are sent on each enabled interface EXCEPT passive interfaces
* multicast on 224.0.0.5
* sent every 10 seconds by default
### Hello packet contents
* Router ID: 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each router
* Hello interval: how often the router sends packets. default 10 seconds.
* Dead interval: how long a router waits to hear from a neighbor before declaring it out of service. Default 4x hello interval
* turning down these values can lead to the network responding faster to changes in the network, but may cause instability with temporary interruptions
* neighbors: a list of adjacent routers that this router has received a hello packet from
* Area ID: area configured for that interface
* Router priority: an 8 bit number used to select DR and BDR
* DR and BDR IPv4 Address: if known.
* Authentication Flag: Authentication details if configured
* Stub area flag: if this area is a stub area. Stub areas have a default route to their ABR rather than learning routes outside the area.
* these settings must match for a pair of routers to form an adjacency:
* must be in each other's neighbor list
* hello and dead intervals
* area ID
* IP subnet
* authentication flag
* stub area flag
### MTU mismatches
* if there is an MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) setting mismatch, then OSPF routers can become neighbors but they will not exchange routes with each other
* MTU is configured at the interface level (default 1500 bytes)
* you can set interface MTU (affects all packets), or interface IP MTU (only affects IP packets)
* not an OSPF setting, a router setting
### Neighbor States
* Down: no active neighbor detected
* Init: Hello packet received from neighbor
* 2-way: own router ID in received hello
* Exstart: primary and secondary roles determined
* Exchange: database description packets sent
* Loading: Exchange of LSRs and LSUs
* Full: neighbors fully adjacent
## OSPF DR and BDR Designated Routers
### OSPF on Multiaccess Segments
* On point to point links, OSPF router pairs form a full adjacency
* on multiaccess segments, such as ethernet, where there can be multiple routers, it is inefficient for all routers to form a full OSPF adjacency with each other
* DR to the rescue!
* DR for Designated Router
* BDR for Backup Designated Router - in case the DR goes down
### DR and BDR
* Elected on each multi-access segment
* at the interface level, not the router level
* router with the highest priority becomes DR, and second highest is BDR
* default priority is 1, the higher the better (0 - 255)
* highest router ID is used in case of a tie
### Neighbor States - 2-way
* On multiaccess segments such as Ethernet, the routers elect the DR and BDR at the 2-way stage
* no election on point to point links
### Setting OSPF Priority
* `interface <interface>`, then `ip ospf priority <0-255>`
* must restart OSPF to take effect, either by restarting the router or shutting down the interface
### Multiaccess Segment Neighbor States
* DR and BDR establish full neighbor state with all routers on the network segment
* the neighbor state of all other routers remains in 2-way and they do not exchange routes with each other directly
### Multiaccess Segment LSA Updates
* when a link state changes on a router connected to a multiaccess segment, it sends a multicast LSU packet to 224.0.0.6 'designated routers'
* DR (not BDR) multicasts the update to 224.0.0.5 'all routers'

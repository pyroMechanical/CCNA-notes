# Cisco Troubleshooting Methodology
* Define problem
* Gather Information (may be able to jump forward to propose hypothesis)
* Analyze Information (may be able to jump ahead to propose hypothesis)
* Eliminate potential causes
* Propose hypothesis (may need to analyze more information)
* Test hypothesis (if failed, go back to gathering/eliminating potential causes)
* Solve problem and document solution
* Approaches can be Top Down, Bottom Up, or Divide and Conquer (from OSI perspective: 7 to 1, 1 to 7, and 3 to 1 plus 3 to 7)
* compare configurations
* trace paths - very commonly used
* swap out components - problem may be at the physical level and not give errors
### Connectivity Troubleshooting Methods
* Ping - verifies two-way connectivity
* Traceroute - does a ping, hop by hop, from source to destination and can indicate which router has a problem
* Telnet - checking to see if a port is open on destination
### Lab Example
* user is complaining that DNS is not working
* DO NOT believe users initially! CONFIRM that there is a problem (check Layer 8 (user) first)

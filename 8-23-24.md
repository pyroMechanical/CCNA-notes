### Administrative Distance Example
* Example: a router receives multiple routes to the 10.10.10.0/24 network from both OSPF and RIP
* when paths to the same destination are received from multiple routing protocols, the lowest administrative distance protocol is used
* then the routes from the same protocol are compared to see the best available path to add to the routing table
### Floating Static Routes
* If the best path to a destination is lost (for example, because a link went down), it will be removed from the routing table and replaced with the next best route
* we might want to configure a static route as a backup for the route learned via a routing protocol
* a problem is that static routes have a default administrative distance of 1 which will always be preferred over routes learned via an IGP
* floating static routes change the default administrative distance of a static route so it will act as a backup, rather than the preferred route
* `ip route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.3.2 <cost>`
* floating static routes can also be used in pure static routing, which prevents load balancing from sending traffic down both directions
* if other routers are along the path with static routing, traffic will still be sent if any intermediate connections go down
# Loopback Interfaces
* Loopback interfaces are logical interfaces
* allow you to assign an IP address to a router or L3 swith that is not tied to a physical interface
* because they have no physical attributes to fail, loopback interfaces never go down
* loopbacks are a logical interface so they cannot be physically in the same subnet as other devices, so they are usually assigned a /32 mask to avoid wasting IP addresses
### Loopback Uses
* best practice to assign a loopback interface to your routers
* used for traffic that terminates on the router itself
* could be management traffic, VoIP, BGP peering, etc.
* provides redundancy in case there are multiple paths to the router
* loopback is also used to identify the router in OSPF
* same loopback interface is usually used for multiple tasks
* multiple loopbacks can be configured, but it's not common. usually only for special use cases
### Loopback Interfaces
* for example, a PC on the 10.1.2.0 subnet wants to connect to R1 to manage it
* if the top path goes down in a triangle configuration, you cannot connect to 10.0.0.1, but if the bottom path goes down you cannot connect to 10.0.3.1
* adding a loopback allows for either path to be used
* adding a loopback at 192.168.1.1/32 that can be advertised
* allows you to connect even if one path goes down
# Adjacencies and Passive Interfaces
* IGP routing protocols are configured under global configuration mode and then enabled on individual interfaces
* when the protocol is enabled, the router will look for other devices on that directly connected link which are also running the routing protocol
* the router does this by sending out and listening to hello packets
* when a matching peer is found, the routers form an adjacency with one another and exchange routing information
### Adjacencies
* Modern routing protocols use multicast for hello packets
* more efficient than broadcast, which was used by earlier protocols
* only routers which are running the same routing protocol will process the packet
### Adjacency Example
* IP subnets configured on the interfaces which are enabled for the routing protocol will be included in its updates
* for instance, R1 has a routing protocol enabled on Loopback0, Fastethernet0/0 and 1/0
* the routing protocol is not enable on FastEthernet2/0, which is not part of our organization
* R1 sends out and listens for hello packets on the loopback0 interface, fastethernet0/0 and 1/0
* will form adjacencies with any routers running the same protocol on those links
* will not send out or listen for hello packets on fastethernet2/0
* not form an adjacency over fastethernet2/0
* must use static routes for extranet traffic with RC over fastethernet2/0
* r1 will not advertise 10.0.2.0/24 (fe2/0)
* RA and RB will not learn routes to 10.0.2.0/24
### Passive Interfaces
* Passive interfaces allow you to include an IP subnet in the routing protocol without sending updates out of the interface
* if FastEthernet2/0 is configured as a passive interface, RA and RB will learn routes to 10.0.2.0, but internal network information will not be sent to RC
* it is best practice to configure loopback interfaces as passive interfaces
* it is impossible to form an adjacency on a loopback interface, as they are not physical interfaces
* making the loopback passive means it will be advertised by the routing protocol, but will not waste resources sending out and listening for hello packets
* passive interfaces are used on loopback interfaces and physical interfaces where the device on the other side belongs to another organization, where we do not want to send routing information out but do want our internal devices to know about that link
# Route Precedence
* Routers learn routes by:
    * An administrator configuring IP addresses on its interfaces (connected and local routes)
    * an administrator configuring static routes on that router
    * receiving them via routing protocols from neighboring routers
* A router's main job is to forward packets received towards their destination, based on the packet's destination IP address
* decides where to forward the packet based on the routes it has learned
* the best route for the packet decision is based on:
    * Longest prefix (most specific)
    * Administrative Distance (which routing protocol is best)
    * Metric (the routing protocol's cost metric)
* if a router learns multiple routes for the exact same network and prefix, it must decide which is the best route
* for instance, if these routes are received:
    * 192.168.0.0/24 via EIGRP from R2
    * 192.168.0.0/24 via OSPF from R3
    it must decide which is a better route
* Only the best route for each learned network and prefix makes it into the routing table and will be used
* the criteria is as Administrative Distance (lower value is better) and in case of a tie, Metric (lower is better)
* if there are multiple routes with the same AD and Metric, they will all enter the routing table and the router will perform equal cost load balancing on them.
### Route Precedence Example Topology
* The following examples are based on the following network topology:
    * R1 is connected to the network 192.168.0.0/30, as well as routers R2, R3, R4, and R5
    * R2, R3, R4, and R5 are ach connected to the 10.x.x.x and 192.168.x.x subnets
* R1 learnes routes 10.0.0.0/24 via RIP from R2, metric 5, 10.0.0.0/24 via OSPF from R3, metric 2. 10.0.0.0/24 via EIGRP from R4, metric 3072, and 10.0.0.0/24 via EIGRP from R5, metric 6144
### Which is best?
* Routes from EIGRP have AD of 90, OSPF have AD of 110, RIP have AD 120
* EIGRP is going to be selected based on Administrative Distance
* route from R4 has an EIGRP metric of 3072, route from R5 has an EIGRP metric of 6144
* R4 metric is lower, and will be added to the routing table over all others.
* if R1 has a destination address of 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.255, it will forward the traffic to R4
* if R5's metric was also 3072, both routes for R4 and R5 would be added to R1's routing table and load balanced.
* if there is a Connected Route with a longer prefix than any other, it will be added to the routing table over all others

### Practice Question
routes learned:
* 10.0.0.0/28 from R2 over EIGRP, Metric 9
* 10.0.0.0/28 from R3 over RIP, Metric 5
* 10.0.0.0/28 from R4 over OSPF, Metric 7
* 10.0.0.0/16 from R5 over OSPF, Metric 6
* 10.0.0.0/16 from R6 over RIP, Metri 4
* 10.0.0.0/16 from R7 over EIGRP, Metric 8
* 10.0.0.0/16 from R8 over OSPF, Metric 9

which router will R1 forward a received packet with destination IP address 10.0.0.16 to?
16 = 5 bits
eliminates all /28 networks

remaining networks, R5, R6, and R8 are all eliminated by Administrative Distance, as EIGRP has the lowest Administrative Distance

R7's interface will be added to the routing table and receive forwarded packets for 10.0.0.16

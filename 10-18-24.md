# Quality of Service
## Congestion Management
* Queueing can be used to manage congestion on routers and switches
* CBWFQ (Class Based Weighted Fair Queueing) gives bandwidth guarantees to specified traffic types
* LLQ (Low Latency Queueing) is CBWFQ with a priority queue
* Traffic in the priority queue is sent before other traffic
### MQC - Modular Qos CLI
* Cisco QoS configuration uses the MQC
* three main sections
* Class Maps define the traffic to take an action on
* Policy Maps take the action on that traffic
* Service Policies apply the policy to an interface
### Congestion Management Example
* 768kbps WAN link between offices
* need to support 10 concurrent voice calls over the WAN
* each call = 25.6 kbps (for theoretical)
* 256 kbps provisioned for voice calls
* 512 kbps provisioned for data
* data will sometimes burst above 512kbps creating congestion
* FIFO queueing will lead to voice packets being stuck behind data packets, making poor quality voice calls
* configure the same LLQ policy on the routers in HQ and branch
* apply to WAN interfaces
* `class-map VOICE-PAYLOAD`
* `match ip dcsp ef`
* `class-map CALL-SIGNALING`
* `match ip dscp cs3`
* `policy-map WAN-EDGE`
* `class VOICE-PAYLOAD`
* `priority percent 33` -guarantees exactly 33% of bandwidth
* `class CALL-SIGNALING`
* `bandwidth percent 5` -guarantees at least 5% of bandwidth, but may allow more
* `class class-default` - all other traffic that we haven't specified higher up
* `fair-queue`
* `interface Serial0/0/0`
* `bandwidth 768`- bandwidth on interface, used for applying percentages
* `service-policy out WAN-EDGE` - applies policy to interface
* don't need to know this configuration, but helps with understanding how it works
## Policing and Shaping
* Traffic shaping and Policing can be used to control traffic rate
* they both measure the rate of traffic through an interface and take an action if the rate is above the configured limit
* traffic shaping buffers any excess traffic so the overall traffic stays within the desired rate limit
* traffic policing drops or re-marks excess traffic to enforce the specified rate limit
* classification can be used to allow different rates for different traffic types
* shaping usually used on the customer end, policing usually used on the service provider end
### Policing Scenario - Service Provider
* in this example, the customer has provisioned an MPLS VPN with a service provider
* the physical links from the CE to PE routers are 100Mbps, but the customer has paid for 10 Mbps in their SLA
* the service provider enables policing inbound on the PE routers to limit the customer to 10Mbps bandwidth. excess traffic is dropped
### Policing with Enterprises
* Another use case for policing is worm and junk traffic mitigation
* an enterprise can configure classification and marking to recognize worms, and junk traffic like peer to peer file sharing applications
* this is known as 'scavenger' traffic, and the recommended DSCP value to mark it with is 8 (CS1)
* Policing can be used to rate limit junk traffic down to prevent it from taking bandwidth from business applications
### Shaping Scenario - Customer CE
* the CE to PE link is 100 Mbps. if the customer sends at a rate above 50 Mbps, excess traffic will be dropped by the provider
* Some traffic would reach the destination, some would not
* the dropped traffic would be random, it could be data or voice
* when voice packets are dropped, call quality is unacceptable
* the customer configures shaping outbound on the CE WAN interfaces, with nested LLQ
### Shaping Scenario - Policy Setup
* `policy-map WAN-Edge`
* `class class-default` - all traffic is shaped
* `shape average 10000000` - shaped to 10Mbps to avoid dropping
* `interface FastEthernet0/0`
* `service-policy out WAN-EDGE` - applies to the interface
* there's still an issue
* 1 mbps is provisioned for voice
* 3 for video
* 6 for data
* data will sometimes burst above 6 mbps creating congestion
* leads to bad voice and video experience
* we must add an LLQ policy as well to prevent this
* `class-map VOICE`
* `match ip dscp ef`
* `class-map VIDEO`
* `match ip dscp af41`
* `class-map SIGNALING`
* `match ip dscp cs3`
* `policy-map NESTED`
* `class VOICE`
* `priority 1024`
* `class VIDEO`
* `priority 3072`
* `class SIGNALING`
* `bandwidth 128`
* `class class-default`
* `fair-queue`
* `policy-map WAN-Edge`
* `class class-default` - all traffic is shaped
* `shape average 10000000` - shaped to 10Mbps to avoid dropping
* added - `service-policy NESTED` - nests secondary policy inside the WAN-EDGE policy
* `interface FastEthernet0/0`
* `service-policy out WAN-EDGE` - applies to the interface

# Cloud Computing
## Traditional IT Deployment Models
* On-premises solutions
* Colocation or 'colo' services
### On Premises Solutions Characteristics
* All equipment is located in your building
* All equipment is owned by you
* There are clear lines of demarcation - Everything in the building is your responsibility, the connections between offices are your network service provider's responsibility
* Equipment is CapEx (capital expenditure, one time purchase)
* OpEx (operational expenditure, ongoing fee)
* new equipment will typically take over a week to deploy
* equipment requires technology refreshes
* need to consider redundancy, avoid single points of failure
### Colocation Facilities
* A colocation center or 'colo' is a data center location where the owner of the facility rents out the space to external customers
* facility owner provides power, cooling, and physical security for their customer's server, storage, and networking equipment
* your user desktops will still be in your normal offices
* Independent colo providers such as Equinix offer customers multiple network connectiivty options through a choice of network service providers
* Network service providers also typically peer with each other in colo facilities
### Colo Solutions Characteristics
* The colo provider owns the data center facility, and is responsible for providing highly available power, cooling, and physical security according to the terms of the Service Level Agreement
* You own your own server, storage, and networking equipment within the colo facility
* The connections between your offices and the colo are your network service provider's responsibility
* Your equipment within the colo facility is a CapEx cost
* the monthly hosting fees to your colo are an OpEx expense
* new equipment will typically take over a week to deploy
* equipment requires technology refreshes
* you need to consider redundancy for the hardware you own, but power and cooling is handled by the facility
* Colo is NOT a cloud solution
## Defining Cloud Computing
* Beginners tend to describe Cloud Computing as 'IT services which are located "somewhere else"'
* but colo facilities are off premises, and they're not cloud
* private cloud deployments are often on premises
* so we need a better definition
### The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing
* National Institute of Standards and Technology provided the industry standard definition of cloud computing in 2011
* "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction"
### On Demand Self Service
* "A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider." -NIST
### Rapid Elasticity
* "Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. to the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time." -- NIST
### Broad Network Access
* "Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogenous thin orthick client platforms (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations)." - NIST
### Resource Pooling
* "The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassinged according to consumer demand." - NIST
### Measured Service
* "Cloud systems automatically control and optomize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate for the type of service (e.g. storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts)." - NIST
## Cloud Computing Case Study
* 3 tier e-Commerce applications
* first tier is front end web servers
* second tier is application middleware servers
* third tier is backend database servers
### Cloud Characteristics
* On-demand self service
* Rapid elasticity
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling
* Measured service
## Server Virtualization
* virtualization is one of the main enablers of cloud computing
* it allows for resource pooling where multiple customers share the underlying hardware
* virtualization has bee naround a lot longer than cloud computing
* this lecture focuses on server virtualization because it was the first type available, but the same principles can be applied to virtualize network infrastructure equipment
### Virtualization
* The cloud provider does not provision separate physical hardware for every customer
* A customer can sometimes deploy selected dedicated hardware devices at additional cost
### Before Virtualization
* dedicated hardware for each role
* server utilization will be low (around 15%)
* you have to pay for each separate server, and they're all using power, space, and cooling
### Multiple Applications on Same Server
* Putting multiple applications on the same server would improve utilization
* very bad practice, beccause if you have a problem with any of your applications, they will all be affected
### Server Virtualization Example
* single physical server box, with CPU, RAM, NIC, etc.
* Hypervisor instead of regular operating system
* on top of the hypervisor, we install a virtual machine
* virtual machine has its own operating system, and is dedicated to one application
* each virtual machine can run specific applications independently
* any issue on one machine will not affect the others
### Popular Type 1 (bare metal) Hypervisors
* Type 1 Hypervisors run directly on the system hardware
* VMware ESXi (part of the vSphere suite)
* Microsoft Hyper-V
* Red Hat KVM
* Oracle VM Server
* Citrix XenServer
### Type 2 Hypervisors
* Type 2 Hypervisors run on top of a host operating system
* VMware Workstation, Player, and Fusion
* VirtualBox
* QEMU
* Parallels
* usually using a Desktop operating system (windows/linux/mac)
* coexists with other applications on host machine
### Containers
* Containers are similar to virtual machines, but they visualize software layers above the operating system layer
* they are software packages that contain an application or microservice and the dependencies required to run it (system executables, libraries)
* considered lightweight because they are smaller in size than virtual machines
* fast to provision
* highly portable across different machines and environments
* docker is the most well-known container engine
## Virtualizing Network Devices
### Virtual Switch
* each VM has its own IP address
* server itself has an IP address too
* management server is hooked up to a single switch
* how does data get sent to the VMs?
* management server uses a virtual switch
* the connected interface is configured as a trunk port
### Virtual Router
* in a cloud environment, virtual switches are not enough
* you want a router to control routing between them
* necessary if you need advanced routing features
* Virtual Router will run as a virtual machine itself, inside the server
* Cisco CSR 1000V
### Firewall Virtualization with Contexts e.g. ASA
* can create separate security contexts in one device
* allows for treating different interfaces as part of different contexts
* behave as completely separate physical firewalls
* could even give management access for the customer's own firewall to your customers
* saves money because you don't need to buy multiple physical firewalls
* also allows for redundancy
### Router Virtualization with VRF
* Virtual Routing and Forwarding
* can have separate routing tables on one router
* differentiated by interface
* can't give customers admin access, since there is only one configuration
### Virtual Routing and Forwarding
* service provider edge routers can use VRF to ensure that no cross-contamination can occur
* routes will never be mixed together
### Summary
* Virtualization supports running multiple virtual systems on a single physical system
* provides flexibility and reduces costs
* redundancy is supported by adding multiple physical systems which each have virtual systems running on them
### Clustering
* Clustering supports combining multiple physical systems into a single virtual system
* provides redundancy and increased performance
* sort of the opposite of virtualization
## Cloud Service Models
* NIST defines three service models of how cloud services can be offered
* IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
* PaaS - Platform as a Service
* SaaS - Software as a Service
* large cloud server providers offer multiple models
* the three models define where the customer and provider areas of responsibility are, and what level the customer gains access
* each model builds on top of the previous
### Data Center Stack
* Facility (building itself)
* Network Infrastructure
* Storage
* Compute
* Hypervisor
* Operating System
* Applications
* Data
### On Premises
* no provider - just you. You cover everything from facility up
### Colo Solutions
* mix in responsibility for the network layer, Colo provider handles facility, you handle rest
### Infrastructure as a Service
* you manage operating system, applications, and the data, everything else is done by the provider
### Platform as a Service
* you manage application and data, everything else done by the provider
### Software as a Service
* Everything is handled by the provider, from facility up
## Cloud Deployment Models
* NIST defines four cloud deployment models
* Public cloud
* Private cloud
* Community cloud
* Hybrid cloud
### Public Cloud
* "Cloud infrastructre is provisioned for open use by the general public. may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. it exists on the premises of the cloud provider" - NIST
* examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Bluemix, Salesforce
* Most common deployment model
### Private Cloud
* "The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g. business units). It may be owned, managed, and organized by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and may exist on or off premises" - NIST
* Private cloud works the same way as public cloud, but the services are provided to internal business units instead of to external public enterprises
### How is Private Cloud different from On Premises?
* private cloud fulfills the cloud 'essential characteristics'
* on-demand self service
* rapid elasticity
* broad network access
* resource pooling
* measured service
* with the traditional On Premises model, a business unit orders a new server by raising a ticket with the IT department. the server is then provisioned and configured by the server, network, and storage teams as separate manual processes
* with private cloud, a business unit orders a new server typically thorugh a web portal. the server is then completely automatically provisioned without requiring manual intervention
* company will use automation software such as cisco UCS director
* Cisco Catalyst Center can be used as an SDN controller
* private cloud is most suitable for large companies where the long term ROI and efficiency gains can outweigh the initial effort and cost to set up the infrastructure and automated workflows
* SDN will be covered in the network automation section
### Private Cloud Examples
* Companies with private cloud don't usually advertise that because it's, well, private!
* most well known example is the US Department of Defense on Private Cloud, provided by AWS. This is an example of a private cloud owned, managed, and operated by a third party.
### Not Really 'Private Cloud'
* Public Cloud IaaS providers will sometimes market dedicated servers as Private Cloud because the underlying servers are dedicated for one customer
* not true private cloud, as the supporting network is still shared
### Community Cloud
* "The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organization that have shared concerns (e.g. mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations)" - NIST
* extremely rare
### Hybrid Cloud
* "The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds)" - NIST
* Companies with limited private cloud infrastructure may 'cloud burst' into public cloud for additional capacity when required
* a company could also have private cloud at their main site and use public cloud for their disaster recovery location
## Cloud Computing Advantages
### Scalability
* Cloud computing provides businesses with the ability to regulate the service in accordance with their current requirements
* scale capacity up or down as needed
* infinite computing capacity on demand
* flexibility through cloud bursting
### Business Agility
* Ability to handle expected or unexpected changes in load
* reduced time to deploy an application into production
### Cost Efficiency
* the customer pays for what they need, resulting in directly proportional costs
* customer avoids provisioning for the peak as a permanent fixture
* move from a large upfront CapEx cost to a comparatively small monthly OpEx cost
* ICT costs are more transparent to the business
* customer does not have depreciably hardware assets
* technology refresh is the responsibility of the cloud providre
* the provider passes hardware and maintenance costs onto the customer as part of that predictable monthly fee, no unexpected costs
### Competitive Advantage
* reducing capital spent on infrastructure releases funds to invest in innovation or other priority areas
* organizations can respond quickly to evolving market trends and focus on growing their core business
### Productivity
* IT staff can focus more on strategic decisions and developing and improving core applications rather than maintaining or troubleshooting hardware infrastructure
* cloud does not mean that in-house IT is not needed anymore. Deploying in a public cloud environment is just like deploying in a new in-house location. In-house IT need to design and support the solution up to the application and data level
### Availability and Reliability
* All major cloud provider's facilities are located in hardened data centers with redundant power, no single poitns of failure, and onsite security
* the service will be certified to the relevant industry standards, such as ISO 9001 (quality) and 27001 (security)
* the data center is built by facilities, server, networking and storage qualified specialists according to best practice
* check the SLA to see what is guaranteed and the compensation if the SLA is not met
### Cost
* The advantages are all great to have, but a decision to deploy cloud computing usually comes down to overall long term cost
* the TCO of maintaining an On Premises solution should be compared to the TCO of maintaining a cloud equivalent, and the advantages and disadvantages of each factored in when making the final decision
* it is not an either/or decision, the majority of companies who use cloud services will have a mix of cloud and on premises solutions

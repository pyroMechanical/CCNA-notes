# Spanning Tree Protocol - cont.
## Spanning Tree and HSRP Alignment
### Spanning Tree and HSRP Relationship
* HSRP should be configured to match the spanning tree path
* in the example, R1 should be given a higher HSRP priority than R2 so it is selected as the HSRP active router
* this allows traffic from the PCs to take the most direct path to their default gateway
* if R2 was the HSRP active router, traffic would have to transit via an extra device, over the CD1>CD2 link
## PortFast, BPDU Guard, and Root Guard
### PortFast
* When a port becomes active, it takes spanning tree 30 seconds by default to ensure it will not form a loop and transition it to the forwarding state
* a device needs at least two bridged LAN connections to form a layer 2 loop
* there isn't really any need for end hosts to wait 30 seconds before forwarding
* you can make a port you are sure will never form a loop transition to a forwarding state immediately when it becomes active by enabling PortFast
* `spanning-tree portfast` to enable on an interface
* `spanning-tree portfast default` will enable by default
### Portfast on Trunk Ports
* Portfast ports are typically access points connected to end hosts
* trunk ports are typically connected to other switches, and should not have portfast enabled
* however, switch ports connected to some specialized hosts, such as router-on-a-stick or virtualized hosts such as VMWare are configured as trunk ports, in order to carry multiple VLANs. These should also be configured as portfast ports
* trunk ports must be configured with `spanning-tree portfast trunk`
### BPDU Guard
* it is best practice to enable portfast for end hosts which will not form a loop
* spanning tree still runs when portfast is enabled
* if a loop is created on a portfast port, it can take time for spanning tree to detect this and block the port. A broadcast storm can occur in this time and crash switches
* a loop can be caused by users adding devices to the network or changing cabling
* you can enable BPDU Guard on Portfast ports to guard against this happening
* if a BPDU is received on the port it will be error disabled (shut down) immediately
* switches send BPDUs, end hosts do not
* BPDU is always used in conjunction with Portfast
* `spanning-tree portfast` then `spanning-tree bpduguard enable`
* `spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default` will enable by default
### Bringing Errdisabled ports back online
* Correct the issue then run 'shutdown' and 'no shutdown' to bring an error disabled port back into service
* you could configure error disable recovery to automatically bring ports back into service after a time period in seconds
* not recommended because it will cause the port to flap up and down until the cause is corrected
## Root Guard
* prevents an unintended switch from becoming the root bridge
* if a port where root guard is enabled receives BPDUs that are superior to the current root bridge, it will transition the port to 'root-inconsistent' and not forward any traffic over the port
* once the issue is corrected and superior BPDUs stop coming in, the port will transition through normal STP states
## BPDU Filter
* Switches send BPDUs, end hosts do not
* BPDU filter is similar to BPDU Guard in that it detects unexpected BPDUs
* BPDU guard error disables (brings down) ports which receive a BPDU
* BPDU filter filters BPDUs on ports but does not err-disable them
* works differently depending on global or interface level configuration
* Global: applies to portfast interfaces. Sends initial BPDUs then stops sending them. if a BPDU is received, it removes portfast, disables BPDU filtering and acts as a normal interface. Similar effect to Portfast Edge
* Interface: Will not send BPDUs and will ignore incoming BPDUs. in effect, this disables spanning tree.
* it is NOT typically recommended to enable BPDU filter. A use case is if you have a single downstream connection to a legacy switch which is causing STP issues.
* `spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default` in global config
* `spanning-tree bpdufilter enable` on the interface
* `spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default` <- will basically NEVER use this
## Loop Guard
### Unidirectional Link Problem
* Many cisco switches support Gigabit Interface Converter/Small Form-Factor Pluggable (GBIC/SFP) modular ports
* the ports take copper or fiber transceivers and are typically used for switch-to-switch connections
* Fiber cables typically have one strand for sending data, and another strand for receiving data, with the opposite order on the other side.
* If one strand fails, it results in a unidirectional link failure
* the interface status can still show as up/up, but data (including BPDUs) can only be sent in one direction
* when a port is up and not receiving BPDUs, it becomes a forwarding designated port
* this can lead to a one way loop between switches
### Unidirectional Link Solutions
* Two methods exist to prevent the unidirectional link problem on Cisco switches:
    * Loop Guard (spanning tree feature, also available in MST)
    * UDLD Unidirectional Link Detection (layer 2 protocol which is not part of spanning tree)
### Loop Guard on Root and Non-Designated Ports
* BPDUs are expected to be received on root ports and blocking ports
* if BPDUs are not received on a loop guard protected root port or blocking port, it will be placed in the loop-inconsistent state with all traffic blocked (rather than becoming a designated port)
* As well as unidirectional link failures, Loop Guard also protects against software failure or data corruptiong preventing BPDUs from being sent on a link
* the port is automatically re-enabled when BPDUs are received again
* `spanning-tree loopguard default` to enable on all ports
* `spanning-tree guard loop` to enable on interface
### Loop Guard on Designated Ports
* BPDUs are not expected on designated ports
* loop guard can be enabled, but will take no action when BPDUs are not detected.
* End hosts do not send BPDUs, but there is no issue if loop guard is enabled on a port connected to an end host as it will be a designated port
### Loop Guard and Root Guard
* Root guard prevents undesired switches from becoming the Root Bridge
* it prevents designated ports from becoming non-designated root ports
* Loop Guard prevents unidirection link failures from causing loops
* it prevents non-designated (root and blocking) ports from becoming designated
* the features are mutually exclusive
* if loop guard is enabled, it disables root guard on that port.
* to enable loop guard and root guard on the same switch, configure them at the interface level
### Verification
* `show spanning-tree summary`
* `show spanning-tree interface <interface> detail`
## PVST+ vs RPVST+ Convergence
### 802.1D and PVST+
* both 802.1D and PVST+ use the same timer based mechanisms to build loop free paths and converge when there is a topology change
* 802.1D uses a single STP instance for all VLANs, PVST+ uses separate instances per VLAN
* PVST+ supports proprietary Cisco features such as portfast, uplinkfast, backbonefast (bypassing timers to improve convergence), root guard, and loop guard (protection mechanisms)
### RSTP, RPVST+, and MSTP
* RSTP, RPVST+ and MSTP use the same mechanisms to build loop free paths and converge when there is a topology change
* RSTP uses a single STP for all VLANs
* RPVST+ uses separate instances per VLAN
* MSTP groups multiple VLANs into spanning tree instances
* RSTP, RPVST+, and MSTP have equivalent convergence to UplinkFast and BacboneFast built-in, the features do not need to be enabled
* RPVST+ supports protection features Root Guard and Loop Guard
* RSTP/MSTP edge port feature corresponds with PortFast in RPVST+
### 802.1D and PVST+ port states
Timers are used to transition ports to the forwarding state:
* Disabled (port is down)
* Blocking (if there has been a link failure and a port ahs to fail over to forwarding, it can remain blocking for up to the Max Age timer, 20 seconds by default)
* Listening: Transitional state, can send and receive BPDUs. Does not forward traffic, does not learn MAC addresses. Forward delay timer is 15 seconds by default
* Learning: Transitional state. can learn MAC addresses, does not forward traffic. Forward delay timer 15 seconds by default
* Forwarding: Forwards traffic. Occurs after 30 seconds by default. Portfast skips the listening and learning states
### 802.1D and PVST+ Convergence
* Can take up to 30 seconds for a port to come online, and up to 50 to converge after a link failure
* the delay of 802.1D and PVST+ is often unacceptable on modern networks
### RSTP Proposal/Agreement Handshake
* Rather than waiting on the BPDU forward delay, and potentially Max Age timers for convergence, RSTP uses a proactive proposal/agreement 'sync' mechanism to rapidly build the spanning tree and respond to topology changes
* switches actively negotiate directly with each other that ports can safely transition to the forwarding state, without the need for timers
* rapid convergence (typically seconds) is achieved across the STP topology
### Cisco supported versions
* Most modern cisco switches support PVST+, RPVST+, and MSTP
* PVST+ is the default on most cisco switches
### Spanning Tree Version Configuratoin
* `spanning-tree mode ?`
* will want to switch to RPVST (cisco only network) or MSTP (open standard)
### Version Interoperability
* Newer spanning-tree versions are backwards compatible with older versions
* newer versions detect older versions based on the protocol version ID and BPDU type fields in the received BPDUs
* STP falls back to the older version on ports connected to switches running the older version
* new version enhancements are not available on these ports
## RPVST+ and Hub Interoperability
### How Hubs Work
* A hub is not layer 2 aware, and does not track MAC addresses
* when a frame is received by a hub, it is flooded out all other ports apart fro the one it was received on
* a hub has no memory to store data, and only one frame can be transmitted at a time. it cannot handle multiple frames at the same time
* hubs only support half duplex communications - packets can only go in one direction at a time on links
### How Switches Work
* a switch is layer 2 aware, and tracks MAC addresses
* when a known unicast frame is received, it is forwarded out the associated port only
* when a broadcast frame is received, it is flooded out all other ports apart from the one it was received on
### Full duplex Communications
* a switch has memory to store data, and can handle receiving frames on different ports at the same time. Each port is handled independently
* switches support full duplex communications, where both devices on either side of a link can send and receive simultaneously
* only two devices can be on a full duplex link, it is point to point. Because there are only two devices, only the switch or the other device on the link can transmit in either direction, and there can be no collisions
### RPVST+ port types
* point-to-point port: automatically assigned to full duplex links
* shared port: automatically assigned to half duplex links
* RSTP Sync rapid convergence is only supported on full duplex point-to-point links
### Port roles and states
* Root and Designated are the same between 802.1D and RSTP, both live forwarding ports
* 802.1D calls blocking ports non-designated, RSTP calls it alternate (or backup),
* disabled in RSTP is called a discarding port state
* 802.1D has both listening and learning, RSTP only has a learning state, and is much shorter by default
### Redundant link through hub: 802.1D
* Interfaces F0/11 and F0/24 on Acc4 are alternate blocking ports
* `show` commands on the switch do not differentiate that F0/24 is a backup of the root port, and F0/11 is a backup of the designated port
* RSTP behavior will have the standby for the designated port makred as a Backup port, not an Alternate port
* Alternate ports are standby ports for a switch's Root port
* RPVST+ supports immediate failover to the alternate port
* RSTP backup ports are standbies of a designated port on a shared segment (i.e. with a hub)
* they do not support immediate failover. Rapid convergence is only supported on full duplex point-to-point links
* hubs are no longer used in modern networks, so you are very unlikely to see a backup port

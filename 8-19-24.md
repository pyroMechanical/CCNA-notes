# Routing Protocol Metrics
### Metrics
* A router may receive multiple possible paths to get to a destination network
* only the best path will make it into the routing table and be used
* different Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) use different methods to calculate the best path to a destination network
* each possible path will be assigned a Metric value by the routing protocol which indicates how preferred a path is
* lowest metric value is preferred (cost)
* Distance Vector routers advertise known networks to each other, and the cost to reach each of them
* Link State routers advertise all the links in their area of the network
* each router takes this information to make an independent calculation of its own best path
* if the best path to a destination is lost (for example, a link has gone down), it will be removed from the routing table and replaced with the next best route
### RIP Metric - Hop Count
* RIP uses Hop Count as the metric
* maximum hop count by default is 15, paths which are more than 15 hops away are marked as unreachable by default.
* RIP is typically usesd only in small or test environments
* tells each adjacent router what networks it has access to, and how far it is
### OSPF Metric - Cost
* OSPF uses 'cost' as its metric, automatically derived by interface bandwidth by default
* can manually configure the cost of links if you want to manipulate the path
### IS-IS Metric - Cost
* not automatically derived from interface bandwidth
* all links have equal cost by default
* you can manually configure the cost of links to control the path
* if you do not manually set the link costs, the path with the lowest hop count will be used
### EIGRP Metric - Bandwidth and Delay
* calculates metric based on both bandwidth and delay of links
* load and reliability can be considered, but are ignored by default
* a fixed delay value is used based on the interface bandwidth, the protocol does not dynamically measure current delay
* can manually configure delay on links to manipulate path
### Choosing a routing protocol
* RIP is not usually used in production networks because of its scalability limitations
* EIGRP is very simple to maintain, calculates changes quickly, and its metric calculation normally chooses the best path by default. Usually only supported on cisco routers.
* OSPF's metric calculation will typically choose the best path by default. open standard which is supported by all vendor's routers and is the most commonly deployed IGP today. more complex than EIGRP
* IS-IS links need to be manually configured or it will use hop count to determine the best path. Typically only used in service provider networks, or for large organizations with their own MPLS network who choose it for scalability
# Equal Cost Multi Path
### ECMP
* if multiple paths to a destination have an equal metric, the router will enter all of the paths into the routing table
* Equal Cost Multi Path will load balance the outbound traffic to the destination over different paths
* all IGP routing protocols perform ECMP by default
* EIGRP is the only routing protocol which is capable of Unequal Cost Multi Path. it must be manually configured to support this.
# Administrative Distance
### Metric
* A router will typically only learn routes to a particular destination from a single routing protocol
* when multiple routes to a destination are learned through a routing protocol, the router will pick the path or paths with the lowest metric into the routing table
* different protocols use different methods to calculate the metric
* in RIP, A>B>C>D has a hop count of 3, path A>B>D has a hop count of 2, so A>B>D is preferred
* in OSPF, if path A>B>C>D has a cost of 60, but A>B>D has a cost of 100, A>B>C>D is used
* if paths to the same destination are received from different routing protocols, their metrics cannot be compared
* for instance, a RIP hop of 5 cannot be compared to an OSPF cost of 60. the comparison is meaningless
* the router needs to use a different method to choose when different routing protocols are used
* administrative distance is used for this
### Administrative Distance
* Administrative Distance measures how trusted a routing protocol is
* if routes to the same destination are received via different protocols, the protocol with the lowest AD wins
### Default Administrative Distance
Connected interface: 0
Static route: 1
External BGP: 20
EIGRP: 90
OSPF: 110
IS-IS: 115
RIP: 120
### Administrative Distance and Metric
* Administrative Distance is used to choose between multiple paths learned via different routing protocol
* Metric is used to choose between multiple paths learned via the same protocol
* Administrative Distance is considered first to narrow the choice down to one protocol
* Metric is then used to choose the best path or paths to enter into the routing table

# Summarisation, Longest Prefix Match, and Default Routes
### Summary Routes
* without static routing, routes on R1:
`ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2`
`ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2`
`ip route 10.1.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2`
* with static routing, summary routes lessen administrative overhead and memory usage on routers
* with static routing, routes on R1:
`ip route 10.1.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.0.2`
* summarisation does not have to happen only at class boundaries
* to summarize range 10.1.0.0 to 10.1.3.0:
* `ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.252.0 10.0.0.2`
### Longest Prefix Match
* when there are oerlapping routes, the longest prefix will be selected
* `ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.0.2` vs `ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.3.2`
* the latter will be chosen, as is more specific ('longest prefix')
### Load Balancing
* when multiple routes of equal prefix length are added for the same destination, the router will add all to the routing table and load balance between them.
### Default Route (Gateway of Last Resort)
* `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <default gateway IP address>`
# Dynamic Routing Protocols
* when a routing protocol is used, routers automatically advertise their best paths to known networks to each other
* routers use this information to determine their own best path to the known destinations.
* when the state of the network changes, such as a link going down or a new subnet being added, the routers update each other.
* routers will automatically calculate a new best path and update the routing table if the network changes.
### Dynamic Routing Protocols vs Static Routes
* Routing protocols are more scalable than administrator defined static routes.
* Using purely static routes is only feasible in very small environments.
##### Dynamic Routing Protocol Advantages
* routers automatically advertise available subnets to each other without the administrator having to manually enter every route on every router
* if a subnet is added or removed, the routers awill automatically discover that and update their routing tables.
* if the best path to a subnet goes down, routers automatically discover that and will calculate a new best path if one is available
* Using a compination of dynamic routing protocol and static routes is very common in the real world
* in this case the routing protocol will be used to carry the bulk of network information
* static routes can also be used on an as-needed basis. for example, for backup purposes, or for a static route to the internet which is then injected into the routing protocol and advertised to the rest of the routers
### Routing Protocol Types
* Routing protocols can be split into two main types:
    * Interior Gateway
    * Exterior Gateway
* Interior gateway protocols are for routing within an organization
* Exterior gateway protocols are used for routing between organizations over the internet
* the only EGP in use today is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
* Interior gateway protocols can be divided again:
    * Distance Vector protocols
    * Link State protocols
##### Distance Vector Routing Protocols
* In distance vector protocols, each router sends its directly connected neighbors a list of all its known networks along with its own distance to each of those networks
* distance vector routing protocols do not advertise the entire network topology
* a router only knows its directly connected neighbors and the lists of networks those neighbors have advertised. it doesn't have detailed topology information beyond its directly connected neighbors
* distance vector protocols are often called 'routing by rumor'
##### Link State Routing Protocols
* in Link State routing protocols, each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbors
* this information is passed unchanged from router to router
* every router has a full picture of the network, including every router, its interfaces, and what those interfaces are connected to
##### Notable Routing protocols
* Distance Vector Protocols:
    * RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
    * EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
* Link State Protocols:
    * OSPF: Open Shortest Path First
    * IS-IS: Intermediate System - Intermediate System
* Exterior Gateway Protocols:
    * BGP: Border Gateway Protocol
##### Interior Gateway Protocols
* All of the IGPs do the same job, which is to advertise routes within an organization and determine the best path (or paths)
* an organization will typically pick one of the IGPs
* if an organization has multiple IGPs in effect (for example, because of a merger), information can be redistributed between them. This should generally be avoided if possible
### Routing Protocol Metrics
* A router may receive multiple possible paths to get to a destination network
* Only the best path will make it into the routing table and be used
* the different IGPs use different methods to calculate the best path to a destination
* each path

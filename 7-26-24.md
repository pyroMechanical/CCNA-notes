# Switch and Router configuration
### Router IP addresses
* Routers provide connectivity between different IP subnets
* an IP address must be configured on the interfaces in each subnet
* begin with 'interface <port>' then 'ip address <address> <subnet-mask>' and finally 'no shutdown'
* 'no shutdown' brings interface up, as they are shut down by default
###  switch management IP addresses
* layer 2 switches are not IP aware, but they do support a single IP address for management.
* the IP address and subnet mask is configured on the Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for the default VLAN 1
* default gateway also needs to be configured to allow connectivity to other subnets
* `interface vlan 1`, `ip address <address> <subnet-mask>`, `exit`, `ip default-gateway <address>`
* switches have interfaces up by default, but using 'no shutdown' is good either way
* configure switch names and interface descriptions
### Speed and Duplex settings
* interface speed and duplex should be auto by default
* both sides of a link should auto-negotiate to full duplex at the fastest speed
* best practice is to manually set the speed and duplex on ports that are connected to another network infrastructure device or server
* important to set matching speed and duplex settings on both sides of the link
### Cisco Discovery Protocol and Link Layer Discovery Protocol
* CDP is a proprietary layer 2 protocol from cisco
* used to share information with other directly connected cisco equipment, such as the operating system version and IP address
* this aids troubleshooting by allowing administrators to map out how cisco devices are connected to each other
* enabled by default on most cisco equipment
* works at layer 2 so not necessary for the device to have an IP address
* commands are `cdp run` to enable, `no cdp run` to disable in global config
* may want to disable for security reasons
* can also disable at individual interfaces with `no cdp enable`
* `show cdp` will show if it is enabled, and `show cdp neighbors` or `show cdp neighbors detail`
* LLDP is an open standard protocol which provides similar information to CDP
* depending on the switch and version, it may be disabled by default
* only supported on physical interfaces
* can only discover up to one device per port
* can discover linux servers
* `lldp run` and `no lldp run` to enable/disable
* `no lldp transmit` AND `no lldp receive` to disable at an interface
* `show lldp`, `show lldp neighbors`, and `show lldp neighbors detail` like cdp
### Layer 1 Troubleshooting
#### Common layer 1 problems
* Interface is shut down
* cable is disconnected on either or both ends
* device on other end is powered off
* broken connectors causing loose connections
* bent or stretched cables with broken wires or fibers
* electromagnetic interference sources like motors or microwaves (newer cable is less vulnerable)
* `show ip interface brief` is useful for layer 1 troubleshooting
* administratively down is solved by issuing `no shutdown`
* down/down indicates a layer 1 issue. check the interface is cabled at both ends and the other device is on
* up/down indicates a layer 2 or speed mismatch issue. check interface config is the same on both ends
* `show interface` also helpful
### Speed and duplex mismatches
* incorrect speed settings can cause an interface to operate below its maximum speed
* speed mismatches usually bring the interface down
* will usually stay up with duplex mismatches, but performance will be awful because of collisions
* both sides of a link MUST BE THE SAME! either auto or manually configure both the same
* cisco devices default to auto
* if one side is auto and the other is misconfigured, this will often result in a mismatch
* best practice is to manually configure ports attached to other network infrastructure devices or servers
* remember to manually configure both sides of the link!
* if a device has issues auto-negotiating speed or duplex, manual configuration will normally solve
* CDP should detect any duplex mismatches
# Cisco Device Management
* ROM, flash, NVRAM, and RAM
### Read only memory
* when device is powered on, it will first load from ROM
* performs power-on self test, then load the bootstrap
* bootstrap looks in flash for operating system
* ROM Monitor (ROMMON) can be used to recover missing or corrupted software images
### Flash memory
* system will first load image found in flash by default
* overridable with `boot system` command
* can copy additional IOS system images to flash via TFTP or USB
### Non-Volatile RAM
* when the system has finished loading the IOS image from flash, it will load the startup-config file in NVRAM
* the saved startup-config becomes the current running-config in RAM
* if no startup-config file is found, the device loads the setup wizard
* whenever a command in IOS is entered, it takes effect immediately and runs in RAM
* to make changes permanent, you need to copy the running config to the startup config
### Random Access Memory
* IOS image and startup config are loaded into flash
* normal working memory of the device
* ROM, flash, and NVRAM are permanent, RAM is volatile and will be cleared when device loses power
* on a switch, the VLAN database (vlan.dat) is either in flash or NVRAM depending on switch model
### Booting from TFTP
* system can also load a system image from an external TFTP server
* not recommended because the device will not be able to boot if it loses connectivity
* usually only used when the device does not have enough flash capacity
### Factory Reset
* `write erase`
* erases startup-config and when rebooted the setup wizard will run
### Config Register
* can be used to change the way the router boots
* `config-register` in global config or `confreg` in rommon
* 0x2102: boot normally (default)
* 0x2120: boot into rommon
* 0x2142: ignore contents of NVRAM (startup-config)
### Password Recovery Procedure
* press the break sequence (ctrl + break) at power on to break into rommon
* `confreg 0x2142` to ignore startup-config on boot
* `reset` to reload in rommon
* router boots with no configuration, type `no` to bypass setup wizard
* enable secret is no longer in running config
* copy the startup config into the running config
* enter a new enable secret in global config mode, then set the config-register back to 0x2102
* finally, copy run start to save the config
### Password recovery on switch
* similar, but may have to physically press a mode button on the front
### Backing up system image and configuration
* Copies of the device's IOS system image and configuration can be saved to flash, FTP, TFTP or USB
* if you copy a config file into the running-config, it will be merged with the current configuration
* to replace a configuration, factory reset and then copy the new configuration into the startup config
* `copy flash tftp` backup image system over the network
* `copy running-config tftp` backup running configuration over the network
* `copy startup-config usb` backup the starting config over USB
### Upgrading the IOS System Image
* can be downloaded from software.cisco.com
* after downloading the software, copy the device's flash using TFTP
* delete the old system image or use `boot system`

# OSPF - Open Shortest Path First
* last Interior Gateway Protocol covered by CCNA
* configuring router ID
* passive interfaces
* default route injection
* OSPF metric - cost
* how to manipulate metric
* OSPF areas - cement larger networks into smaller areas to put less load on the routers
## OSPF Characteristics
* OSPF is a Link State protocol
* supports large networks
* very fast convergence time
* messages sent with multicast
* open standard protocol
* uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm to determine the best path to learned networks
### OSPF vs EIGRP vs RIP
* RIP has scalability limitations so is not typically used in production networks, suitable for small networks or lab/test environments
* the choice for most companies comes down to either EIGRP or OSPF
* OSPF is the more commonly used of the two
* supports large networks and has always been an open standard, supported on equipment from all vendors
* EIGRP can be simpler to implement and troubleshoot, but was historically cisco proprietary
* now an open standard, but there is still limited support on other vendor's equipment
* OSPF very similar to EIGRP
### Link State Routing Protocols
* in Link State protocols, each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbors
* this information is passed unchanged from one router to another
* every router learns the full picture of the network, including every router, its interfaces, and what they connect to
* OSPF routers use LSA link state advertisements to pass along routing updates
### OSPF operations
1. Discover neighbors
2. Form adjacencies
3. Flood link state database (LSDB)
4. Compute shortest path
5. Install best routes in routing table
6. Respond to network changes
### OSPF Packet Types
* Hello packet: sent out and listened for when enabled, and will form adjacencies with other routers on the link
* DBD (Database Description): Adjacent routers will tell each other the networks they know about within the DBD packet
* LSR (link state request): if a router is missing information about any of the networks in the DBD, it will send that neighbor an LSR
* LSA (link state advertisement): a routing update
* LSU (link state update): contains a list of LSA's which should be updated, used for flooding
* LSAck: acknowledgement of LSA
## OSPF Basic Configuration
* Different interfaces on a router can run in different instances of OSPF
* different instances have different link state databases
* only one instance is typically configured on OSPF routers - multiple process IDs are very rarely used
* Process ID is locally significant; does not have to match on the neighbor router to form an adjacency
### Configuration - Process ID
* if R2 is connected to R1 and R3, and all three are running OSPF, R2 will form adjacencies even if their process IDs do not match on the connected interface
* R1 and R3 will NOT learn each other's routes, because they are in different process IDs on R2
* NOT a normal configuration!
* normal configurations have all routers on the same process ID
### Configuration - Network
* the network command uses a wildcard mask, like EIGRP
* inverse of subnet mask
* OSPF does not default to using the classful boundary
* you MUST enter a wildcard mask
* command: `network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0`
* this command means:
    * look for interfaces with an IP address that falls within the range 10.0.X.X
    * enable OSPF on those interfaces - send and listen to OSPF hello messages, and peer with adjacent OSPF routers
    * advertise the network and mask which is configured on those interfaces
    * does not auto-summary, will not advertise 10.0.0.0/16
* `sh run | section ospf` will show all OSPF commands running in your config
* `show ip protocols` shows all routing protocols on that router
* `show ip ospf interface brief` reveals the interfaces on that router that have OSPF enabled
### OSPF Operations
* `show ip ospf neighbor` will show all formed adjacencies
* `show ip ospf database` shows information discovered about the network
* `show ip route` will show best routes found by ospf
## OSPF Advanced Topics
### Router ID
* OSPF routers identify themselves using an OSPF router ID in the format of an IP address
* defaults to being the highest IP address of any loopback interfaces configured on the router, or the highest other IP address if no loopback exists
* loopback interfaces never go down, so the router ID won't change if one is configured
* you can also manually specify the router ID
* best practice is to use a loopback or to manually set the router ID
* without a loopback, the OSPF router ID is not static between restarts
* loopback is always preferred if present
### Passive Interface Configuration
* loopbacks should be configured as passive interfaces
* external networks should also be passive interfaces
* `router ospf 1` then `passive-interface <interface>`
* if more interfaces are passive, you can set passive as the default for all interfaces with `passive-interface default` and then make interfaces active with `no passive-interface <interface>`
### Default Route Injection
* similar to RIP
* create a default route with `0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <address>`
* `router ospf 1` then `default-information originate`
* `show ip route` on other routers will show the default on other routers
* external routes in OSPF are not necessarily external to the network, but were injected into OSPF directly
### OSPF Areas
* Every router learns the full picture of the network, including every router, its interfaces, and what they connect to
* can cause issues in large networks:
    * too many routes can use too much router memory
    * network changes cause all routers to reconverge which takes time and CPU resources
    * the larger the network, the more problems this causes
* OSPF supports a hierarchical design which segments large networks into smaller ones in order to solve this problem
* each router maintains full information about its own area, but only summary information about other areas
* two-level hierarchy
* transit area (backbone or area 0) does not generally contain end users
* regular areas (non-backbone areas) are used to connect end users to transit area. by default, all transit traffic goes through the transit area
* small networks do not require this hierarchical design, and all routers can be in area 0
### OSPF Configuration - Network
* `network 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0`
* any interface with that IP range will be added to area 0
* for a router to form an adjacency, its neighbor must be configured to be in the same area
### OSPF Router Types - Backbone Routers
* a Backbone router has all its interfaces in Area 0
* routers maintain a full LSDB of other routers and links in their own area
* routes received from other routers in the same area appear as Internal OSPF routes
### OSPF Router Types - ABRs
* routers which have interfaces in multiple areas are Area Border Routers (ABRs)
* ABRs separate LSA flooding zones
* primary point for area address summarization
* functions regularly as the source for default routes
* maintains the LSDB for each area which it is connected to
* ideal network design has ABRs connected to only two areas: the backbone area and regular area
### Manual Summarization
* ABRs do not automatically summarize
* if you do not configure summarization, all routes are flooded everywhere
### Inter Area Routes
* Routes to other areas appear as IA routes
### Normal Area Routers
* all of its interfaces are inside a normal area
* normal internal routers
* routers maintain a full LSDB for other routers and links in their own area
* learn inter area routes to outer areas from their ABRs
### ASBRs
* Autonomous System Boundary Router
* redistributes other routes into OSPF
* routes which are redistributed into OSPF appear as external routes
## Bandwidth vs Clock Rate and Speed
### the `speed` command
* the rate that ethernet interfaces physically transmit is set by the `speed` command
* gigabitEthernet interfaces transmit at 1000 Mbps by default
* FastEthernet transmits at 100Mbps by defualt
* if you use `speed 10` on FastEthernet interfaces, it will physically transmit at 10 Mbps
### the `clock rate` command
* the rate that Serial interfaces physically transmit at is set by the `clock rate` command
* default to 1.544 Mbps
* if you use `clock rate 64000` it will physically transmit at 64 Kbps
### the `bandwidth` command
* interfaces also have a default bandwidth (eg 100 mpbs on fastethernet, 1.544 on a serial interface)
* bandwidth usually matches the physical transmission rate of the interface
* `bandwidth` setting WILL NOT alter physical transmission speed
* bandwidth affects software policy on the router, such as which path is selected by EIGRP or OSPF
* may also be used for how much bandwidth Quality of Service can guarantee
* you can influence software policy by altering the bandwidth on an interface, though this isn't always used
### OSPF Cost Metric
* as OSPF is a link state routing protocol, the router will learn abotu all destinations in its area, the links to them, and their cost
* router selects routes based on the lowest cost to reach
### OSPF Link States
* in a multi-area OSPF network, ABRs know the information for each connected area
* when multiple areas are in use, each router has individual routes for each IP subnet in its own area, and summary routes to other areas via an ABR
### Metric Calculation
* for destinations in its own area, a router looks at all available links and chooses the path with the lowest overall cost
* for destinations in another area, the router looks for all available links to the ABR and chooses the path with the lowest overall cost to the ABR, which is then responsible for choosing the best path from there
* Shortest Path First algorithm calculates the overall cost for each available path to each destination network, and selects the lowest cost path
* overall cost = cumulative cost of all outgoing interfaces
* you should ensure the cost is set the same on the interfaces on both sides of a link or you can get asymmetric routing
### Reference Bandwidth
* cost = reference bandwidth / interface bandwidth
* defaut bandwidth is 100 mbps
* OSPF treats all interfaces of 100 Mbps or faster as equal
* can be undesirable for modern networks with higher bandwidth interfaces
* you can alter the reference bandwidth with `auto-cost reference-bandwidth <cost in Mbit>`
### Manipulating OSPF Metric
* OSPF takes the bandwidth into account, so higher bandwidth links will be preferred
*ito account  the most efficient path will *usually* be preferred
* if you want to use a different path, you can manipulate either the bandwidth or the cost directly
* generally preferred to change cost instead, as bandwidth can have many effects
* `show ip ospf interface <interface>` will show cost of the interface

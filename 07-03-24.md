# How to make the most of this course
* theory lecture first in order
* Lab exercises in lectures
* watch lectures start to finish, then do lab exercises
* establishes fundamentals of the tech and gives skills to configure
* powerpoints designed to be useful for notetaking
* additional material on [website](https://www.flackbox.com/tutorials)
# Recommended practice tests
* [Alpha Prep](https://www.flackbox.com/apccna)
# Changes for v1.1
* DNA center (rebrand to 'Catalyst Center') not called out in automation and programmability
* Puppet and Chef removed, Ansible still in, Terraform has been added.
# Added Topics
* Spanning Tree Loop Guard in spanning tree section
* BPDU Filter
* Cloud managed network device access methods
* REST based API authentication types
* AI and machine learning in network operations


# OSI model
* Seven layers, from top to bottom going down from user to connection
Physical
Data Link
Network
Transport
Session
Presentation
Application

*use acronym "Please Do Not Take Sales People's Advice"

# TCP/IP
* Contains 4 layers which encapsulate the whole of the OSI model
Application: Covers Application, Presentation, and Session info
Transport: equivalent to Transport
Internet: equivalent to Network
Network Access: Covers Data link and Physical
### Host communication terminology:
* Application layer: Data
* Transport layer: Segments
* Internet layer: Packets
* Network Access layer: Frames
* Total unit is a Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
* PDU is commonly called 'packet' in day to day usage

# Upper OSI layers - 7, 6, and 5
* Primarily not worked on by network engineers, important for app devs
* Important to know what they do
### Application Layer
* Provides network services to the applications of the user
* no services to any other OSI layer
* establishes the availability of intended communication partners
* synchronizes and establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery and data integrity
### Presentation Layer 
*can translate between multiple data formats using a common format (i.e. for computers with different encoding schemes)
### Session Layer
* establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between two hosts
* also synchronizes dialog between the presentation layers of two hosts
* manages data exchange between hosts
* example: web servers that have many processes open at any given time
* efficient data transfer
* Class of Service
* exception reporting of problems above it

# Lower OSI layers - 4, 3, 2, and 1
* Bread and butter of network engineers
### Transport Layer
* Main characteristic is whether TCP or UDP is used, and port number
* defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble data between end devices.
* breaks down large files into smaller segments that are less likely to fail.
* UDP is more important for speed over accuracy, and in lossy applications like streaming
* TCP is used when everything must arrive at the other end, for instance, web pages
### Network Layer
* most important information is the source and destination IP addresses
* where routers operate!
* connectivity and path selection between two host systems that may be on geographically separated networks
* manages connectivity of hosts with logical addressing (IP)
### Data-Link Layer
* most important information is source and destionation layer 2 addresses
* e.g. MAC address for Ethernet
* Switches operate at layer 2
* defines how data is formatted for transmission, and controls access to physical media
* error detection and correction is usually (though not always!) included
### Physical Layer
* concerns the literal, actual physical components of the network
* e.g. network cables
* enables bit transmission between end devices
* defines specifications needed for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical connection between end devices
* voltage levels, physical data rate, maximum transmission distance, connectors, etc.

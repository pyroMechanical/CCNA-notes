# DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
* DHCP is a client/server protocol that automatically provides a host with its IP address and other related configuration information, such as the subnet mask and default gateway.
* DHCP clients obtain their IP information from a DHCP server, rather than being manually configured.
### How DHCP Works
* Client sends out a DHCP Discover message (broadcast)
* the server will then reply with a DHCP Offer
* client responds with a Request (broadcast)
* the server finally responds with an Acknowledgement
### DHCP Benefits - reduced network administration
* Centralized and automated IP configuration, rather than manually assigning an IP address to every host
* can assign additional IP configuration values by means of DHCP options
* efficient handling of clients that must be updated frequently, such as laptops that move between different locations on a wireless network.
* the forwarding of initial DHCP messages by using a DHCP relay agent, which eliminates the need for a DHCP server on every subnet
### DHCP Benefits - reliable IP address configuration
* DHCP minimizes configuration errors caused by manual IP address configuration, such as typos, or address conflicts caused by the assignment of an IP address to more than one computer at the same time
### DHCP Clients
* Desktop PCs and laptops are good candidates to be DHCP clients because there will typically be many of them in the office. DHCP saves a lot of admin work that would be necessary if manually configuring IP addresses.
* they do not accept incoming connections, so it does not matter if their IP address changes.
* Servers and network infrastructure such as routers and switches will not typically be DHCP clients.
* They are mission-critical devices which do not move, and are required for the network and its services to function.
* Their IP addresses are manually configured, to ensure they will not change and disrupt the network.
## Cisco DHCP Server
### Option 1: Cisco DHCP Server Configuration
* Preferred for small networks, where the expense of a dedicated DHCP server would be undesirable for the benefits
* to configure a cisco router to act as a DHCP server:
* `ip dhcp excluded-address 10.10.10.1 10.10.10.10`
* `ip dhcp pool <name>`
* `network 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0`
* `default-router 10.10.10.1`
* `dns-server 10.10.20.10`
* for verification: `show ip dhcp binding`
### Option 2: External DHCP Server Configuration
* preferred for larger networks, where reliability is more important and the cost of dedicated server(s) is a worthwhile tradeoff
* as routers, by default, do not forward broadcast traffic, we need to make an exception for DHCP traffic
* on the interface receiving the DHCP requests, enter `ip helper-address <dhcp server IP>`
### Configuring a Cisco Router as a DHCP Client
* Cisco routers are typically manually configured with static IP addresses
* an exception to this is where an office is connected to the internet but has not bought static public IP addresses (because it does not contain any publicly available servers which would need a fixed IP address for incoming connections)
* the office still requires a public IP address to allow internal hosts outbound connectivity to the internet through NAT
* in this case, the router will receive the public IP address on its outside interface from the ISP via DHCP
* to set up an interface as configured by DHCP, type `ip address dhcp` followed by `no shutdown` to bring the interface back up
* to view info about the DHCP lease, use `show dhcp lease`

# HSRP - Hot Standby Router Protocol
* Redundancy is important in an organization's network, to ensure that any one device failing does not lead to the entire network going down
## Network Redundancy
* in the examples so far, all the network infrastructure devices have been a single point of failure
* if any switch or router goes down, the PCs will lose their internet access
* this is common for small branch offices where the cost of adding redundant devices cannot be justified
* the point of redundancy is to eliminate single points of failure
* by adding redundant switches, routers, and network connections, we can still reach the internet if any one link fails
* in a real world network the core/distribution layer switches would typically be layer 3 switches
* layer 2 switches are used in examples to aid understanding
### Access Layer
* redundancy is not typically implemented at the access layer because end hosts only have a single network card
* servers with redundant network cards are an exception
### Layer 3 Configuration
* Redundancy and failover are relatively easy to implement for layer 3 routing
* routes on R1:
* static route to SP1
* backup default static route via R2 if link to SP1 goes down (with higher administrative distance)
* `ip route <addr> <mask> <route> <admin. distance>`
* and Backup route to inside via R2 if link to CD1 goes down
## FHRP - First Hop Redundancy Protocols
### Host Gateways
* we have redundant gateways for the PCs in the 10.10.10.0/24 network:
* R1 with IP address 10.10.10.2
* R2 with IP address 10.10.10.3
* we could configure half our PCs to use R1 as their default, and the other half to use R2
* that would be inconvenient and would require manual reconfiguration on the PCs to failover if one of the routers failed
### a better solution: FHRP
* with FHRP, a virtual IP (VIP) and MAC address are used to allow for automated gateway failover
* the hosts use the Virtual IP as their default gateway address
* if a physical gateway fails, another will take over
### FHRP Protocols
* HSRP: Hot Standby Router Protocol. Cisco Proprietary, deployed in active/standby pair
* VRRP: Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol. Open standard, similar to HSRP, also deployed in an active/standby pair
* GLBP: gateway Load Balancing Protocol. Cisco proprietary, supports active/active load balancing across multiple routers
## HSRP
* HSRP uses a VIP and Mac Address to allow for automated gateway failover
* the hosts use the VIP as their default gateway access
* if the active gateway fails, the standby gateway will take over
### HSRP operations
* both routers have a normal physical IP address and MAC address on their HSRP interface. unique addresses are used on each router
* they also btoh have the HSRP virtual IP and MAC address configured on the interface. The same address is used on both routers
* when they come online, one router is elected the HSRP active router, and the other is the standby
* active router owns the virtual IP and MAC address and responds to ARP requests
* All traffic for the VIP goes through the active router
* the routers send hello messages back and forth
* if the standby router stops receiving hellos from the active, it will take over the VIP and MAC addr
* will now be the new active router
### HSRP Configuration
* in r1, on the interface set up the standard ip addr as usual
* after bringing the interface up, add `standby 1 ip 10.10.10.1`
* same on r2 but with a different physical IP
* `show standby` to verify
## HSRP Advanced Topics
### Priority and Pre-emption
* You can choose which router will be active by setting priority on the routers
* the router with the highest priority will be preferred (default 100)
* in the event of a tie, the highest IP address wins
* if pre-emption is enabled, when a higher priority router comes back online, it will transition back to active
* if pre-emption is not enabled, the lower priority router will remain active
* this can be more stable if the higher priority router is flapping on and off
### Configuration
* `standby 1 priority <number>`
* `standby 1 preempt` on the higher priority router
### Versions
* HSRP version 2 introduced a few improvements
* default is version 1
* `standby version <1 or 2>`
* `show standby` to verify
### Multi-active HSRP Option 1
* can set up additional virtual IP addresses under different numbers
* `standby <number>`
* allows you to divide traffic between routers
* each PC must use a specific default gateway, so you must configure each PC to prefer one or the other
### Multi-active HSRP Option 2
* divide along subnets
* this way not every PC needs to be configured, as the subnets will be what determines which priority each router has

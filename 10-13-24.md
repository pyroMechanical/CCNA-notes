# The Security Threat Landscape
## Firewalls vs Packet Filters
### How Stateful Firewalls Work
* Firewalls secure traffic passing through them by either permitting or denying it according to their rules
* Stateful firewalls maintain a connection table which tracks the two-way state of traffic passing through the firewall
* return traffic is permitted by default
* firewall rules examples:
    * Deny all traffic from outside to inside
    * permit outbound web traffic from 10.10.10.0/24
* if 10.10.10.10 sends outbound traffic to 203.0.113.10, it is allowed as outbound traffic from 10.10.10.0/24 is allowed
* connection table: 10.10.10.10:49160 > 203.0.113.10:80
* traffic from 203.0.113.10:80 > 10.10.10.10:49160 is permitted because it is valid return traffic for a connection in the connection table
* overrides the 'deny all outside traffic' rule
* if no connection from inside has been made, the server's traffic would be dropped from the 'deny all outside traffic' rule
### Next Generation Firewalls
* Next Generation Firewalls move beyond port/protocol inspection and blocking to add application-level inspection, intrusion prevention, and user based security
* Deep packet inspection analyses packets up to layer 7 of the OSI stack
* Different permissions can be applied to different users
* the Cisco ASA with FirePower is a Next Generation Firewall
### How Packet Filters Work
* An Access Control List security policy is a packet filter
* packet filters do not maintain a connection table
* they affect traffic in one way only, and do not track the state of two way connections going through the router
* If you have an ACL applied on the way out only, the return traffic will be allowed because all traffic is allowed when an ACL is not applied
* if you have ACLs in both directions, you will need explicit entries to allow both the outbound and the return traffic
* ACL example:
    * Inbound ACL on the outside interface: Deny all traffic
    * Inbound ACL on the inside interface: permit web traffic from 10.10.10.0/24
* 10.10.10.10 sends outgoing web traffic to 203.0.113.10
* inbound ACL on inside interface allows the traffic to the web server
* the connection IS NOT TRACKED in a connection table
* traffic from the web server is dropped because the outside interface's inbound ACL denies all traffic
* to allow the return traffic, you either need to remove the deny all traffic rule, or add `permit tcp any eq 80 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 range 49152 6535`
* neither option is secure for a router connected to the internet
### The 'Established' Keyword
*  `established` added at the end of access-list command
* does not actually track the state of the connection
* only checks for the 'Ack' flag in return traffic
* does not make a router a stateful firewall, and still does not keep a connection table
### IOS Firewall
* you can configure a router as a stateful firewall with the IOS Firewall feature set
* different commands than ACLs
### Internal and External Threats
* ACL packet filters can add to an overall defense in depth strategy
* Standard practice is to use firewalls on major security boundaries, and augment this with interanl ACLs
* Purely external threats are primarily covered with strong firewall and IPS protection on the network perimeter
* Sensitive hosts should also have firewall and IPS protection from internal hosts
## Cryptography
* Cryptography transforms readable messages into an unintelligble form and then later reversing the process
* can be used to send sensitive data securely over an untrusted network
* uses authentication and encryption methods
### Cryptography Services
* Authenticity (proof of source)
* Confidentiality (privacy and security)
* Integrity (has not changed in transit)
* Non-repudiation (non-deniability)
### Symmetric Encryption
* with symmetric encryption, the same shared key both encrypts and decrypts the data
* shared key is known by both the sender and receiver and must be kept secret
* very fast
* used for large transmissions (email, secure web traffic, IPsec)
* Algorithms include DES, 3DES, AES, SEAL
### Symmetric Encryption - Confidentiality
* host 1 encrypts data with shared key, producing garbled data
* garbled data is sent over network
* host 2 uses the shared key to decrypt the garbled data, producing the desired data
### Asymmetric Encryption
* Asymmetric encryption uses public and private key pairs
* data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa
* data encrypted with the public key CANNOT be decrypted with the public key
* only the private key must be kept secret
* public key can be available in the public domain
* slow compared to symmetric
* used for small transmissions like sharing symmetric keys
* Algorithms include RSA and ECDSA
### Asymmetric Encryption - Confidentiality
* host 1 encrypts message witht public key
* garbled data is sent over the network
* host 2 decrypts the message using the private key, producing the message
* this allows anyone to send data securely to the host with the private key
* only one with the private key is the host, so nobody else can read the message
* other hosts with the public key CANNOT read the message
### Asymmetric Encryption - Authenticity and Non-Repudiation
* host 2 encrypts data with private key and sends it to host 1
* host 1 can request data from host 2 to be encrypted, to ensure that it is genuinely host 2
### HMAC Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes
* HMAC codes provide data integrity
* sender creates a hash value from the data to be sent using a symmetric key
* hash value is appended to the data
* receiver hashes the data with the shared key
* if the hash values are the same, the data has not been altered in transit
* used for large transmissions (eg email, secure web traffic, IPsec)
* algorithms include: MD5, SHA
### Key Distribution
* Cryptography can be used to send sensitive data securely over an untrusted network
* Symmetric key encryption is used for bulk data transmissions
* Each side needs to know the shared key
* this leads to a key distribution problem
* when you buy something online, you want your credit card details to be encrypted over the internet
* the online store can't send you the shared key over the same internet channel - it's not secure
* not practical to phone the customer every time someone wants to make a purchase
### Public Key Infrastructure
* PKI uses a trusted introducer for the two parties
* both parties need to be able to trust the Certificate Authority
## TLS - Transport Layer Security
### SSL, TLS, and HTTPS
* SSL: Secure Sockets Layer (deprecated)
* TLS: Transport Layer Security (successor to SSL)
* Can be used to provide secure web browsing with HTTPS (can also be used with other applications such as email)
* uses symmetric cryptography to encrypt transmitted data
* symmetric keys are generated uniquely for each connection
* authentication is provided by public key cryptography
* Message Authentication Code provides security
* your web browser trusts the public Certificate Authorities and has a copy of their public keys
* this allows you to verify that the certificate is correct, as the certificate authority will have signed the certificate
* anybody could have sent you the valid certificate for amazon
* to confirm, your computer will send some data to amazon and request its encryption
* this then verifies that you can indeed trust that connection
* your browser could now encrypt your credit card details with the private key when you make a purchase, and nobody else would be able to read the details
* however, asymmetric encryption is slow and not suitable for bulk data exchange like web browsing
* symmetric key encryption should be used, but the server and you do not have a shared key
* but if you sent a symmetric key with the private key, you can communicate information with a shared key on both sides of the link!
### Circumvention (or lack thereof)
* Hackers also shop on amazon and have a copy of amazon's certificate, they could make a website looking like that website and trick you into going, then use amazon's certificate
* your browser will ask them to authenticate with amazon's private key, and they don't have it
* they could get the certificate from a public certificate authority, but those do out of band checks to verify they are only issuing legitimate certificates
* could open a business and get a public certificate for it, then trick you into going a website that pretends to be amazon and send you their certificate
* certificate details which website it is valid for and it is checked by your browser
* could install their own certificate authority and create their own certificate for amazon.com, then trick you into going to a website that pretends to be amazon.com and send their new certificate
* your browser will not trust the new authority as web browsers only trust certain public certificate authorities
## Site-to-Site VPNs
* Site-to-Site VPNs use symmetric encryption algorithms such as DES, 3DES, and AES to send encrypted traffic between locations over an untrusted network such as the internet
* traffic inside an office is often unencrypted as it is seen as a trusted network
* VPN tunnels can be deployed internally, if desired
* Cisco TrustSec is another solution for internal authentication and encryption
* Site-to-Site VPN tunnels typically terminate on a firewall or router on both sides
* a pre-shared key can be configured on both sides of the tunnel, or certificates can be used
* Certificates offer a more scalable solution
* pre-shared keys are pretty commonly used
### IPsec
* IPsec is a framework of open standards that provides secure encrypted communication on an IP network
* Internet Key Exchange (IKE) handles negotiation of protocols and algorithms, and generates the encryption and authentication keys
* Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) defines the procedures for authenticating and communicating peer creation and management of security associations. It typically uses IKE for key exchange.
* Authentication Header (AH) provides integrity ,authentication and protection fom replay attacks
* Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and protection from replay attacks
* ESP is more commonly used
* AH does not provide confidentiality
### ESP Tunnel Mode
* Tunnel Mode protects the internal routing information by encrypting the IP header of the original packet. the original packet is encapsulated by another set of IP headers
* widely implemented in site-to-site VPN scenarios
### ESP Transport Mode
* encrypts only the payload and ESP trailer, so the IP header of the original packet is not encrypted
* IPsec transport mode is implemented for client-to-site VPN scenarios
* transport mode is usually used when another tunneling protocol (such as GRE, L2TP) is used first to encapsulate the IP data packet, the nIPsec is used to protect the GRE/L2TP tunnel packets
### IPsec VPN Implementation
* Interesting traffic: the VPN devices recognize the traffic to protect
* ISAKMP/IKE phase 1: the VPN devices negotiate an IKE security policy, authenticate each other, and establish asecure channel
* ISAKAMP/IKE phase 2: negotiate an IPsec security policy to protect IPsec data
* Data Transfer: the VPN devices apply security services to the traffic, then transmit
## Remote Access VPNs
### Cisco AnnyConnect
* Cisco AnyConnect is a Remote Access VPN application which uses the ASA firewall
* uses TLS instead of IPsec
* while SSL is technically deprecated, TLS is often still described as SSL
### Split Tunneling
* internet traffic goes out to the internet, and not over the VPN
* less latency/better performance as internet traffic does not require going through the office before reaching the internet
### Full Tunneling
* all traffic goes through VPN to corporate office, then gets sent out to the internet
* allows enforcing security policy when outside the office, such as blocked sites
## Threat Defense Solutions
### Malware
* Antimalware software should be installed on host systems
* uses signatures and heuristics to detect malicious software and block it from running
* controls should be in place to prevent users from disabling the software
* an IPS can also be used to detect and block network traffic containing malware
### Malware, Phishing, and Data Exfiltration
* the Cisco ESA Email Security Appliance scans links and attachments in incoming email for malware, phishing attacks, and spam
* the cisco WSA Web Security Appliance prevents users from accessing dangerous websites
* Policies can also be implemented on the ESA and WSA to prevent sensitive information from being sent out of the organization
* Policies and procedures should be implemented, for example about how and what information can be sent or taken outside the company premises
* Security awareness training should also be implemented
### Reconnaissance and Social Engineering
* Low level reconnaissance and social engineering can use very low tech methods to gain information and access to the target organization
* as such it is difficult for IT departments to use technical solutions to protect against them
* the way to defend against them is thorugh staff security awareness
* policies and procedures should be implemented
* staff should be educated about security concerns
* an IPS can dfeend against deper reconnaissance which uses port and vulnerability scanners
* it is not normal behavior for a host to scan through a range of port numbers
* an IPS can detect and drop the traffic
* a determined attacker may attempt to circumvent this by running the scan over a longer time period
### DDoS
* an IPS can detect DDoS attacks through anomaly-based inspection
* advanced firewalls can offload incoming connection attempts from servers when the traffic rate reaches a threshold, and respond with quicker connection timeouts and/or cookies
* Anti DDos services such as Arbor Networks monitor global internet traffic to detect botnets and command and control servers
* they have on premises and cloud based solutions which scrub traffic when an organization is under DDoS attack
* geographic dispersion of an organizations services can help mitigate DDoS attacks
### Spoofing, MITM, and Reflection Attacks
* Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) verifies a source IP address is reachable through the same interface it was received on
* When an attacker spoofs their source IP address, they do not receive return traffic so they do not see the sequence numbers in TCP responses from the target. a target may be more vulnerable to attacks if it uses predictable TCP sequence numbers
* applications should be up to date and patched to prevent this
* when they are in the traffic path, advanced firewalls can also randomize TCP sequence numbers
* Secure authentication proves that systems are communicating with who they think they are
* Dynamic ARP Inspection detects and blocks ARP spoofing attacks
### Password Attacks
* Firewalls and packet filters should be configured to prevent illegitimate users from connecting to login windows
* policies should be in place to enforce secure passwords
* password complexity settings include minimum password length, special character requirements, how often passwords must be changed, and prevention of old passwords being reused
* Multi Factor authentication should be used where suitable. this could be something the user knows (a password) or something they have (a biometric reader, or a code generated on a mobile app or security device)
* staff should be educated to guard against social engineering attacks
### Buffer Overflow Attacks
* Software should be up to date and patched so that it rejects malformed packets
### Packet Sniffers
* Packet filters and firewalls should be used to ensure traffic paths are controlled
* Traffic should be authenticated and encrypted if it passes over an untrusted network
### Penetration Testing
* A penetration tester can be employed to test the organization's security defense
* uses the same tools and methods as a hacker
* internal security teams should do their own testing of their security systems and policies
* an external tester can be used for validation

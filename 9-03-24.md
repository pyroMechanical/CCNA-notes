# VLANs - Virtual Local Area Networks
## Campus Design - Access, Distribution, and Core Layers
* The campus LAN should be designed for scalability, performance, and security
* to aid in a best practice design process, the network topology is split into access, distribution, and core layers
* the layers have their own design principles and characteristics
### Campus Design - Access Layer
* assume a main building and secondary building, each with multiple access layer switches
* access layer switches are where end hosts will connect
* designed to have a high port count at an affordable cost
* desktops typically only have one network interface card, so they can only connect to one switch or wireless access point
* servers will often have dual NICs and connect to a pair of redundant switches
* client access security measures are enabled at the access layer
### Campus Design - Distribution Layer
* access layer uplinks to the distribution layer
* switches at the distribution layer serve as an aggregation point for the access layer and provide scalability
* distribution alyer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream access layer switches connected to both
* end hosts are generally not connected directly to the distribution switches
* most software policy such as Quality of Service are enabled at this layer
### Campus Design - Core Layer
* distribution switches uplink to the core layer
* core layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream distribution layer switches connected to both
* traffic between different parts of campus travel through the core layer, so it is designed for speed and resiliency
* software policy slows the switch down, so it should be avoided on the core layer.
### Collapsed Distribution and Core
* Smaller campuses do not need the scalability of three separate layers
* in these cases, a collapsed distribution and core layer is used, where both layer functions are on the same devices
## Spine-Leaf Network Design
* in modern data centers, there is a trend to have a lot more traffic going between servers themselves, rather than between clients and servers (east-west vs north-south)
* Spine-leaf networks are better for this situation
* to scale out, you can just add additional switches in the east-west direction
* all leaf switches are connected to all spine switches
## Why we have VLANs
### Router Operations
* Routers operate at layer 3 of the OSI stack
* hosts and separate IP subnets must send traffic via a router to communicate
* security rules on routers or firewalls can be used to easily control what traffic is allowed between different IP subnets at layer 3
* Routers do not forward broadcast traffic by default
* they provide performance and security by splitting networks into smaller domains at layer 3
### Switch Operations
* Switches operate at layer 2
* they *do* forward broadcast traffic by default
* by default, a campus switched network is one large broadcast domain
* switches flood broadcast traffic everywhere, including between different IP subnets
* this has performance and security issues
### Unicast traffic in the same IP subnet
* within the same IP subnet, a switch can route traffic alone
* outside of it, it must go through a router
* router can implement security policies to limit traffic between subnets
### Broadcast Traffic Problem
* if a device sends out broadcast traffic to a switch, it will flood out all ports, even if they are on different subnets and should not be receiving traffic
* this affects security because the traffic bypasses the layer 3 security policies
* it affects performance because every end host has to process the traffic
* also uses bandwidth on links where the traffic is not required
* scales massively when multiple switches are connected together
### VLANs: Virtual Local Area Networks
* We can increase performance and security in the LAN by implementing VLANs on our switches
* VLANs segment the LAN into separate broadcast domains at layer 2
* there is typically a one-to-one relationship between a subnet and a VLAN
* By having two separate VLANs tied to each subnet, the switches will not send broadcast traffic across the VLAN boundary
* broadcast traffic stays on the same VLAN it originated at
* unicast traffic works the same in both cases, but broadcast traffic will not be sent out to the other VLANs, and is stopped at the router.
## VLAN Access Ports
* Access ports are configured on switch interfaces where end hosts are plugged in
* Access ports are configured with a single specific VLAN
* the configuration is on the switch, the end host is not VLAN aware
* switches only allow traffic within the same VLAN
* if a VLAN is misconfigured, no traffic can reach the misconfigured port
* hosts that are in the same subnet should be in the same VLAN
* default VLAN is VLAN 1, until you configure VLANs, the entire network is one broadcast domain
* `vlan <number>` in terminal configuration
* `name <name>` will give the vlan a name
* need to configure the interface, which you do by entering `switchport mode access` followed by `switchport access vlan <number` in the interface configuration
* to configure multiple ports, you can supply `interface range <type>x/y - z`
* can verify with `show vlan brief` in privileged mode, or `show interface <interface> switchport`
## VLAN Trunk Ports
* connections between switches, if assigned to only one vlan, can't connect multiple end hosts across different switches
* rather than configuring the connections between switches as access, which can only work for one VLAN, a trunk port can send traffic for multiple VLANs
* Dot1Q trunks are configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs
* ISL was a cisco proprietary technology that is now obsolete
### Dot1Q Trunsk
* When the switch forwards traffic to another switch, it tags the layer 2 Dot1Q header with the correct VLAN
* the receiving switch will only forward the traffic out ports that are in that VLAN
* the switch removes the Dot1Q tag when sending the traffic to the end host, as they are not VLAN aware
* Dot1Q header is inserted between the source MAC address and the Type in an Ethernet frame
### Hypervisors - VLAN aware Hosts
* End hosts are typically members of only one VLAN and are not VLAN aware
* a special case is virtualized hosts, where there are virtual machines in different IP subnets on the host
### Voice VLAN
* IP phones are another exception, since IP phones usually are also connected to the PC to reduce port usage
### Configuring Trunk Ports
* on the interface level, `switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`, followed by `switchport mode trunk`
* the first message (switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q) is only relevant on older network equipment that supports the now-deprecated ISL, and will give an error on modern equipment
* IP phones use a special configuration, which is in the access mode, but still carries two vlans when a cisco IP phone is connected
### Native VLAN
* the switch needs to know which VLAN to assign to any traffic which comes in untagged on a trunk port
* this used to be required for when a switch was connected to a hub. Hubs are layer 1 devices so not VLAN aware
* native VLAN is used for this
* the default native VLAN is VLAN 1
* hubs are long gone, so this is less relevant
* best practice is to use an unused VLAN
* the native VLAN must match for the trunk to come up
* `switchport trunk native vlan <number>`
* `show interface <interface> switchport` to verify
### Limiting Allowed VLANs
* mainly for security reasons, but can improve performance as well
* if one switch has three VLANs, but the other has only two of them, we don't want to send traffic for the third VLAN
* to do this, on both switches, we can configure the allowed VLAN list
* on the interface, `switchport trunk allowed vlan <number>, <number>, ...`
## DTP - Dynamic Trunking Protocol
* if two cisco switches are cabled together, they can negotiate a trunk connectino using cisco's Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
* it is, however, recommended to manually configure switch ports and not use DTP
* if you are going to use DTP, here is how:
* `switchport mode dynamic auto` will form a trunk if the neighbor switch port is set to trunk or desirable. trunk will not be formed if both are on auto. default on new switches
* `switchport mode dynamic desirable` will form a trunk if the neighbor is set to trunk, desirable, or auto. default on older switches
* `switchport nonegotiate` disables DTP
## VTP - VLAN Trunking Protocol
* the Vlan Trunking Protocol (VTP) allows you to add, edit, or delete VLANs on switches which are configured as VTP servers, and others which are configured as VTP clients will synchronize their VLAN database with them
* this can be convenient if you manage a large campus
* you still need to perform port level VLAN configuration on the switches
* Be careful when using VTP - if you accidentally introduce a switch with a higher database revision number into the domain, it can wipe out all your production VLANs
* if using both DTP and VTP, the VTP domain name has to match on neighbor switches for trunks to be formed by DTP
### VTP Modes
* VTP Server: can add, edit, or delete VLANs. a VTP server synchronizes its VLAN database from another server with a higher revision.
* VTP Client: can't add, edit, or delete VLANs. a VTP Client will synchronize from the server with the highest revision.
* VTP Transparent: does not participate in VTP, does not advertise or learn VLAN information, but will pass it along. can add, edit, or delete VLANs in its own local VLAN database.

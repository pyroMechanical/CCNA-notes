## IPv6 Static Routes
* IPv6 routing works the same way as IPv4 routing, but the processes are separate, and there are separate IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables
* if a router receives an IPv4 packet, it will route it according to its IPv4 routing table
* if it receives an IPv6 packet, it will route it according to its IPv6 routing table
* the routing tables are built in the same way, through static routes or via dynamic routing protocols
### IPv6 Routing Protocol Support
* Updated versions of the existing IPv4 routing protocols were released to support IPv6
* the configuration and operation is very similar for IPv6 as for IPv4
### IPv6 Routing
* IPv4 routing is enabled by default on a cisco IOS router
* IPv6 routing is disbaled by default
* enter the command `ipv6 unicast-routing` to enable it
* you can still configure IPv6 addresses on a router without IPv6 unicast-routing enabled and send and receive IPv6 traffic, but the router will not forward IPv6 traffic to other networks
### Connected and Local Routes
* the administrator configures IP addresses on the router's interfaces
* a router can be IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or both (dual-stack)
### show ip route - IPv4 Routes (review)
* This will automatically enter connected and local routes in the routing table
* Local IPv4 routes always have a /32 mask and show the IP address configured on the interface
### show ipv6 route - IPv6 Routes
* Local IPv6 routes always have a /128 mask and show the IP address configured on the interface
### Routing
* If a router receives traffic for a network which it is not directly attached to, it needs to know how to get there in order to forward the traffic
* an administrator can manually add a static route to the destination, or the router can learn it via a routing protocol.
* `ipv6 route <routed addr> <connected addr>`
### IPv6 Summary and Default Routes
* `ipv6 route 2001:DB8:0::/48 2001:DB8:0::2` summary route
* `ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1:1::/64 2001::DB8:1::2` network route
* `ipv6 route ::/0 2001:DB8:3::2` default static route

# Wide Area Networks
## WAN Overview
* a Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and other devices in a relatively small area, typically a single building or a group of buildings.
* a Wide Area Network (WAN) is a geographically distributed network that connects multiple Local Area Networks together
* a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a network that connects computers and other devices in a geographic area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN
* MANs are less common, and you could desribe them as types of WANs as well
* lots of different ways a WAN can be designed
## VPNs - Virtual Private Networks
### Private vs VPN connections - Private Networks
* a private network uses links which are dedicated for an individual organization
* Local Area Networks are private networks
* Wide Area Networks can also use physical links which are dedicated for an individual organization
* with a standard private network, you can send traffic over a private link to reach the internet, even if it is remote
* a VPN provides a virtual tunnel between private networks across a shared public network, such as the internet
* Traffic traveling over the tunnel is encrypted and only readable by the authorized users on both sides
* users can share data over the tunnel as if they were connected with a dedicated private link
* virtual because it is not an actual point-to-point link
* VPNs allow an organization to use the same physical links for connectivity to the internet and between offices
* because they use shared infrastructure, VPN connections are typically less expensive than dedicated physical links
### Site to Site VPN
* Site to Site VPN connections are terminated on a router or firewall in each office
* software does not need to be installed on end user hosts
* IPsec is typically used for encryption
### Remote Access VPN
* Remote Access VPN connections are between a router or firewall in the office and VPN software installed on an individual user's device
* the user can access the VPN from anywhere with internet connectivity
* they usually use SSL for encryption, but may use IPsec
### Site to Site IPsec VPN configuration options
* IPSec Tunnel: open standard IPsec tunnel, does not support multicast
* GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) over Ipsec tunnel: adds support for multicast
* IPsec VTI (Virtual Tunnel Interface): Cisco proprietary simplified configuration, supports multicast
* DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN): Cisco proprietary. Scalable simple hub and spoke style configuration that enables direct full mesh connectivity between all offices
* FlexVPN: Cisco proprietary. Very similar to DMVPN, newer technology
* GETVPN (Group Encrypted Transport VPN): Cisco proprietary. Scalable centralized policy for vVPN over non-public infrastructure, eg MPLS.
## WAN Connectivity Options
* Multiple options are available for connecting geographically dispersed offices together.
* Not all options are available in all locations
* what is commonly used in one region may be considered legacy in another.
* Different providers may use different terminology. Terminology in this lecture is that used by Cisco for the CCNA Exam
### Primary WAN Connectivity Options
* Leased Line
* MPLS Multi Protocol Label Switching
* Satellite
* the service provider will typically provide an SLA (service level agreement) which guarantees for uptime and traffic delay and loss on the link
* Leased lines and satellite can be used for connectivity to the internet, for direct connectivity between offices, and/or connectivity between offices over VPN
* MPLS uses a shared core infrastructure at the service provider. It can be used for connectivity to the internet and/or connectivity between offices over VPN (NOT direct connectivity!)
### Optical Fiber
* Optical fiber is more suitable for long distances than copper
* commonly used for service provider backhaul connections, but can also be offered to their customers
* FTTx services:
* Fiber to the Home
* Fiber to the Premises
* Fiber to the Building
* Fiber to the Neighborhood
### SONET and SDH
* SONET (in north america) and SDH (rest of world) are the standards used in service provider optical networks
### DWDM Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
* DWDM multiplexes multiple optical signals into one optical signal transmitted over a single fiber strand
* each signal is assigned to a different wavelength
* DWDM allows more capacity to be added to existing infrastructure without expensive upgrades
* DWDM is used in all modern long haul optical connections
### Dark Fiber
* many service providers laid optical fiber cabling in the past and thend found they didn't need it
* DWDM was a major reason for this
* the unused cabling can be offered to customers as 'dark fiber'
### WAN Backup and Small Office Solutions
* Less expensive options which are often aimed at home user internet access can be used as internet/VPN/WAN backup options in corporate environments
* typically no corporate level SLA with these services
* these can be used as the primary WAN connection method to the corporate network from smaller offices and for home networks
* DSL Digital Subscriber Line
* Cable
* Wireless, eg 4G
### Legacy WAN Connectivity Options
* PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network (dialup)
* ISDN Integrated Services Digital Network (dialup modems, higher bandwidth than a single line)
* Frame Relay
* ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode
* X.25
### Interface Cards
* Routers will typically come with on-board Ethernet ports. Additional Ethernet interface cards can be added
* Ethernet is often used for WAN connections today
* other WAN interfaces are modular and can fit into a spare slot on the router
* there are many different types of WAN interface card
* part numbers for different cards can be very similar
* different cards are compatible with different router platforms
* be very careful when selecting your card! it's easy to make mistakes.
## Leased Lines
* a leased line is a dedicated physical connection between two locations
* it has fixed, reserved bandwidth which is not shared with anyone else
* the same bandwidth is available in both directions
* the company may own the cable infrastructure, but more commonly it is leased from a service provider for a monthly fee, hence the name 'leased line'
* first location is typically a corporate office
* the second location is typically:
    * another office, providing point-to-point connectivity
    * a data center that's connected to the existing corporate WAN, providing multipoint connectivity between offices
    * a data center that's connected to the internet, providing internet connectivity, and optionally corporate office connectivity over internet VPN
* leased lines us a serial connection requiring the correct physical interface card in the router
* they do not use an ethernet port
* in north america, common bandwidth options are T1 (1.544 mbps), T2 (6 mbps), T3 (45 mbps), and T4 (275 mbps)
* in europe, E1 (2 mbps), E2 (8 mbps), E3 (34 mbps), or E4 (140 mbps)
### Benefits and Drawbacks
* leased lines have fixed, reserved bandwidth which is not shared with anyone else.
* the service provider will typically provide an SLA with guarantees for uptime and traffic delay and loss on the link
* typically more expensive than the other options
* usaully a longer lead time for installation
* copper or fiber ethernet connectivity options to the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) are becoming more common than serial leased lines
### Satellite
* Satellite connections sahre the same characteristics as cabled leased lines
* typically expensive and low bandwidth
* typically used if they are the only option, such as in hard-to-reach remote areas
### Phone lines
* T1 and E1 links were also commonly used for connections to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)
* the analog phone cable in your house is capable of carrying one call
* a T1 digital line is capable of carrying 24 concurrent TDM calls, and E1 can carry 30
* VoiP using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) signaling over ethernet WAN connections to the telco are popular today
### MPLS Multi Protocol Label Switching
* WAN connectivity can be provided over an MPLS infrastructure, usually operated bya  service provider
* traffic from multiple customers can travel over the provider's shared MPLS network, so this is a VPN service
* different levels of SLA for uptime and traffic delay and loss are often available at different price points
* Ethernet connections are typically used to connect down to the customer router
* MPLS VPNs provide a full mesh topology by default
* PE: provider edge router
* CE: customer edge router
* P: provider core router
### Layer 3 MPLS VPN
* MPLS runs across the provders core on the PE and P routers
* the CE routers do not run MPLS
* the CE routers peer at layer 3 with the PE routers
* static routes or a routing protocol runs between the CE and PE
* the PE router looks like another customer router to the customer
* the provider's core routers are transparent to the customer
* the customer's sites are in different IP subnets
### CE router configuration
* configuration is identical for static and dynamic routes
* technologically all routing protocols are supported, but service providers will often not support all of them for convenience
### Layer 2 MPLS VPN
* the CE devices do not peer with the PE devices. the entire provider network is transparent to the customer
* the provider network acts like a giant switch
* customer sites are in the same IP subnets
* CE devices on a layer 2 networks can be either switches or routers
* this may be required for clustering an application over the WAN
* it can also be useful for migrating hosts during Disaster Recovery
### Layer 2 MPLS Terminology
* VPLS (Virtual Private LAN Service): multipoint layer 2 VPN
* VPWS (Virtual PseudoWire Service): point to point layer 2 VPN

# Wireless Networking Fundamentals
## Wireless Network Types
### 802.11 WiFi
* WiFi services are defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard
* IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
### Wireless Network Types
* WPAN - Wireless Personal Area Network
    * devices within 10 meters of each other
    * bluetooth is often used
* WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network
    * provides access to a campus (typically wired) network, without the need for a cable
    * devices within 100m of a Wireless Access Point
* WMAN - Wireless Metropolitan Area Network
    * Covers a large area, such as a city
* CCNA focus on WLAN
### Ad Hoc Networks
* Two or more wireless stations communicate directly with each other
* devices communicating wirelessly on network are called 'stations'
* IBSS - Independent Basic Service Set
* Scalability issue as all stations must be within their mutual range
### Infrastructure Mode
* Stations communicate via a Wireless Accecss Point (AP)
* this can provide access to a wired network
* Multiple access points can be deployed to provide the required coverage area
### Ad-Hoc vs Infrastructure Mode
* Wireless stations work in either ad-hoc or infrastructure mode
* they cannot operate in both at the same time
### WiFi direct
* WiFi Direct allows device to be connected to an Access Point and also be part of a peer-to-peer wireless network
* it does not operate in ad-hoc IBSS mode, it is an extension to Infrastructure Mode
* WPS WiFi Protected Setup enables connection setup by pushing a button
* it is WPAN Wireless Personal Area Network
### WiFi Direct Predefined Services
* Miracast to wireless external monitor
* DLNA Digital Living Network Alliance allows devices to stream music and video
* Direct Print
### Wireless Bridges
* Wireless Bridges can be used to connect areas which are not reachable via cable to the network
### Mesh Networks
* Another option to spread coverage area of a WLAN is Mesh
* oen AP radio is used to serve clients
* the other radio connects to the backhaul network
## Infrastructure mode and Wireless Access Points
### Wireless Access Points
* Wireless Access Points provide connectivity between wireless stations and between the wireless and wired networks
* Wireless is half-duplex
* only one device can communicate at a time
### Cisco Aironet Wireless Access Point
* can have internal or external antennas
* designed for indoor or outdoor use
### BSS Basic Service Set
* An Access Point centralizes access and control over a group of wireless devices
* the devices and their wireless settings make up a BSS
### Distribution System
* A distribution system connects Wireless Access Points to the wired network
### BSSID - Basic Service Set Identifier
* Devices within Basic Service Sets are identified by their BSSID, which is based on their MAC address
### BSA - Basic Service Area
* wireless coverage area of an Access Point
* also known as a wireless cell
### SSID - Service Set Identifier
* SSID is a unique identifier that names the wireless network (WLAN), for instance 'corporate'
### Multiple SSIDs
* A single Access Point can support multiple SSIDs
* for example 'Corporate' and 'Guest'
* different SSIDs can have different security settings, and be mapped to different VLANs
### Beacons
* Wireless access points broadcast information about their WLANs (including the SSID and authentication requirements) with beacon frames
* this can be disabled
* trivially easy to sniff if disabled
### ESS - Extended Service Set
* the same SSID can be supported across multiple access points to give a larger coverage area
### Roaming
* Wireless client stations can roam across wireless APs supporting the same WLANs
## Wireless LAN Controllers and CAPWAP
### Wireless LAN Controllers
* In a large campus, configuring a large amount of Access Points one by one becomes unmanageable
* A Wireless LAN Controller can be used as a central point of management
* Virtual Wireless Controller is also available
* redundancy is supported
### Autonomous vs Lightweight Access Points
* Standalone Access Points are known as Autonomous access points
* Access Points with a WLC are known as Lightweight Access Points
* The installed software image determines whether an Access Poitn is Autonomous or Lightweight
### Zero Touch Provisioning
* Lightweight Access Points support Zero Touch Provisioning
* They discover their Wireless LAN Controller via these options:
    * DHCP - Option 43 gives the IP address of the WLC
    * DNS - 'cisco-capwap-controller' resolves the IP address of the WLC
    * Local subnet broadcast
### Access Points and the WLC
* the lightweight access point downloads its configuration from the Wireless LAN Controller
* this includes what WLANs it should support and their settings
* the WLC also monitors the wireless quality and controls the channels and power of the Access Points
* can also detect Rogue APs
### Roaming with Wireless LAN Controller
* Wireless stations can roam across Wireless APs supporting the same WLAN
* the infrastructure can be configured to make roaming seamless
### CAPWAP
* Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) is a standardized protocol that enables a Wireless LAN Controller to manage a collection of Wireless Access Points
* Communications are encrypted inside a DTLS CAPWAP tunnel
* it uses UDP ports 5246 and 5247
### Split MAC
* Work is moved from the APs to the WLC which is why they are called Lightweight APs
* Real-Time traffic is still handled by the AP in order to provide suitable performance, the rest is handled by the WLC
* this is known as 'Split MAC'
### Split MAC - AP Operations
* Client handshake when connecting
* Beacons
* Performance monitoring
* Encrypting and decryption
* Clients in power save
### Split MAC - WLC Operations
* Authentication
* Roaming Control
* 802.11 to 802.3 Communication
* Radio Frequency Management
* Security Management
* QoS Management
### Traffic Flow with CAPWAP
* Management traffic between the AP and WLC also passes through the CAPWAP tunnel
* LAG - Link Aggregation (Etherchannel) is often used on the WLC to switch link
### FlexConnect
* Traffic is forwarded locally when FlexConnect is configured
* this is useful for small branch offices without a Wireless LAN Controller
## Switch Configuration for Wireless Networks
* Autonomous AP will tag the frames with their vlan information, which will be routed by switches just like any other packet
* Autonomous AP will need to be connected with a trunk port
* With CAPWAP, the Access Point will send the packet to the WLC *without* tagging it
* WLC sees which vlan to tag the traffic, and will then send it to the switch
* from the AP, the switch will forward to the WLC, from the WLC it will direct traffic as normal
* traffic from AP is sent on the same VLAN, which should be separate from the VLANs served by the WLC
* Configure the interface connected to the WLC as a trunk for the management and WLAN VLANs
* Communication between teh WLC and APs is tunneled inside a CAPWAP tunnel
* Configure the interface connected to the AP as an access port in the AP management VLAN
## Wireless Channels and Radio Frequencies
### Wifi Spectrum
* WiFi services operate in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency spectrum
* this is allocated for ISM - indistrial, scientific, and medical use
* a radio operator's license is not required
* ISM devices do not have regulatory protection against interference from other users of the band
### IEEE 802.11 Standards
* 802.11 - 1997, 2.4 GHz, up to 2 Mbps
* 802.11a - 1999, 5 GHz, up to 54 Mbps
* 802.11b - 1999, 2.4 GHz, up to 11 Mbps
* 802.11g - 2003, 2.4 GHz, up to 54 Mbps, compatible with 802.11b
* 802.11n - 2009, 2.4 & 5 GHz, up to 600 Mbps, backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g
* 802.11ac - 2013, 5 GHz, up to 3500, backwards compatible with 802.11n and 802.11a
* 802.11ax - 2013, 2.4, 5, & 6 GHz, up to 9608 Mbps, backwards compatible with all 802.11 standards
* Cisco Access Points support all standards
* you can choose which you want to enable per WLAN
* each amendment is backward compatible at the same frequency. This enables you to replace APs but keep older clients
### 2.4 GHz Spectrum
* The 2.4 GHz ISM spectrum ranges from 2.4 to 2.835 GHz
* (2.4 to 2.497 GHz in Japan)
* the spectrum is divided into smaller (22 MHz) ranges of frequencies called channels
* each AP operates in one channel
* some channels overlap and can cause interference with each other
* Access Points with overlapping service areas should use non-overlapping channels
### 5 GHz Spectrum
* 2.4 GHz channels are 22 MHz wide
* 5 GHz channels are 20 MHz wide
* they have less overlap than 2.4 GHz channels
* neighboring APs should be separated by at least one channel
* Channels can be bonded (40, 80, or 160 MHz wide) to multiply data rates by 2, 4, or 8 times
### 2.4 GHz Interference
* The ISM band is unlicensed
* Many devices can cause interference in the 2.4 GHz range
### 2.4 vs 5 GHz
* 2.4 GHz has greater range and better propagation through obstacles
* 2.4 GHz is more crowded
* 5 GHz 802.11ac has higher throughput than is available with 2.4 GHz
* client stations may only be compatible with 2.4 GHz
### Site Surveys
* Site surveys should be carried out for WiFi networks
* the purpose is to find the best placement of Access Points for maximum coverage of the required area, and minimum leakage outside it
* It should also discover potential sources of interference
* A WLC can manage channel allocation and power levels of APs for best wireless quality
### Wireless Security
* WiFi coverage can leak outside the desired area
* end stations do not need physical access to join the network
* this can make it more vulnerable to attack
* strong authentication and encryption techniques should be used
### Security standards
* WEP Wired Equivalent Privacy (1999) - RC4 encryption
* WPA WiFi Protected Access (2003) - RC4 encryption, TKIP Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
* WPA2 (2004) - AES encryption, CCMP Counter Cipher Mode with Block Chaining Message Authentication Code protocol
* WPA3 (2018) - AES Encryption, CCMP, protection against KRACK attack
### WPA Personal and WPA Enterprise
* Personal uses pre-shared keys (PSK)
* Enterprise uses a AAA server

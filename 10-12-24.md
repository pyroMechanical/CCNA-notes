# Wide Area Networks
## PPPoe Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet
### WAN Backup and Small Office Solutions
* Less expensive options often aimed at home user Internet access are often used as Internet VPN WAN backup options in corporate environments
* These can also be used as the primary WAN connection method to the corporate network from smaller offices and for home users
* DSL Digital Subscriber Line
* Cable
* Wireless eg 4G
* Typically no corporate level SLA because of multiple providers
### PPPoE
* commonly used in DSL deployments
* PPPoE can be configured on either the DSL modem or the router
## WAN Topology Options
### Hub and Spoke (Star)
* one main office, each other branch office is connected to main office, branch offices not connected to each other
* Advantages: simplicity, centralized security policy
* Disadvantages: single point of failure, suboptimal traffic flow
### Redundant Hub and Spoke
* Same as above, with secondary hub that is connected to the main hub
* Advantages: removes single point of failure, centralized security policy
* Disadvantages: Higher cost, suboptimal traffic flow
### Full Mesh
* Each office is connected to each other office
* Advantage: Optimal traffic flow
* Disadvantage: cost, high complexity
### Partial Mesh
* Tradeoff between others
* hub and spoke, but some branches are connected
* Advantage: slightly higher cost of hub and spoke, but certain branches get better traffic flow where it matters
### Internet Redundancy Options
* Single Homed: customer router is connected to service provider router with a single link
* Single point of failure
* Dual Homed: two routers on each end with one connection, improved redundancy and reliability
* Still has a single point of failure if the service provider has an issue
* Multi Homed: same as dual homed but with 2 different providers
* Dual Multihomed: 2 each router is connected to each service provider
# The Security Threat Landscape
## Overview
### Terminology
* Threat: has the potential to harm an IT asset
* Vulnerability: a weakness that compromises the security or functionality of a system
* Exploit: uses a weakness to compromise the security or functionality of a system
* Risk: the likelihood of a successful attack
* Mitigation: techniquest to eliminate or reduce the potential of and seriousness of an attack
### Malware
* Malware is any malicious software. Various types of malware include:
* Viruses: software which inserts itself into other software and can spread from computer to computer. Requires human action to spread
* Worms: self-propagating viruses that can replicate themselves
* Trojan Horses: malicious software which looks legitimate to trick humans into triggering it. Often installs back doors
* Ransomware: encrypts data with the attacker's key and asks the victim to pay a ransom to obtain the key.
### Hacking Tools
* Many toolsets are available
* Penetration testers use the same tools as hackers to test for vulnerabilities
* Hacking tools typically run on linux
* tools include:
* Password cracking tools
* Sniffers
* Ping sweepers
* Port and vulnerability scanners
### Script Kiddies vs Targeted Attackers
* 'Script Kiddies' is a derogatory term for low skilled hackers who download and use off-the-shelf hacking software to launch exploits
* typically attempt to exploit any vulnerable host they can connect to
* attacks are mostly not targeted against a particular individual or organization
* more skilled attackers will also look for random victims in order to meet their goals, such as installing ransomware or a botnet
* organizations are constantly under these types of attacks
### Targeted Attacks
* directed against a particular individual or organization
* much rarer
* skilled attackers will typically start off with very stealty and low impact reconnaissance, and systematically escalate the attack from there
### Evolution of a targeted attack
* external reconnaissance
* initial compromise
* escalation of privilege
* internal reconnaissance
* further compromise
* further escalation
* end goal
## Common Attacks
* reconnaissance obtains information about the intended victim
* in a targeted attack, they will typically start with completely unobtrusive methods, such as searchign whois information, phone directories, job listings, etc.
* They will then dig deeper using tools such as ping sweeps or port and vulnerability scanners
### Social Engineering
* use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information
* no more technical than use of telephones or email
* the attacker will often pretend to be somebody else to trick the victim
### Phishing
* a social engineering attack where the attacker pretends to be from a reuptable company to get individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers
* the victim is often directed to enter their details into the attacker's website which looks like the reputable company's legitimate website
### Data Exfiltration
* where data leaves an organization without authorization
* may be a hacker who has compromised a system
* may be an internal staff member, either maliciously or by accident
### DoS Denial of Service
* prevents legitimate users from accessing an IT resource
* typically a brute force style of attack which floods the system with more traffic than it can handle
* DoS attacks from a single source are easily stopped by blocking traffic
### Example: TCP Syn-flood attack
* a malicious attacker just refuses to send the acknowledgement
* done on many connections to exhaust the resources on the target system
### DDoS Distributed Denial of Service
* DoS from multiple sources
* attacker buidls and controls a botnet army of infected zombie hoests
* the botnet is built through malware such as worms and trojan horses
### DDoS and Botnets
* infected hosts connect out to the attacker's command and control server. this circumvents firewalls becausse the connection is initiated from the inside
* the attacker now has control of the botnet to launch attacks
* DDoS attacks are more difficult to mitigate against because the attack comes from multiple sources which could normally be expected to send legitimate traffic
### Spoofing
* an attacker fakes their identity
* types include:
    * IP address spoofing
    * MAC address spoofing
    * Application spoofing (eg rogue DHCP server)
### Reflection and Amplification attack
* reflection attack is a DoS attack where the attacker spoofs the victim's source address
* the attacker sends traffic supposedly from the victim which elicits a response from 'reflectors'
* amplification causes a large amount of response traffic to the victim
### Man in the Middle Attacks
* attacker inserts themselves into the communication path between legitimate hosts
* the attacker can read and optionally modify the data
* ARP spoofing is a well-known man in the middle attack
### Password Attacks
* if an attacker has connectivity to a login window, they can attempt to gain access to the system behind it
* enumeration techniques attempt to discover usernames
* password cracking techniques attempt to learn user passwors
* methods include:
    * guessing
    * brute force
    * dictionary attacks
### Buffer Overflow Attacks
* send malformed/too much data to the target system
* can cause denial of service or compromise the system entirely
### Packet Sniffers
* if an attacker has compromised a target system or inserted themselves into the network path, packet sniffers such as wireshark can be used to read the sent and received packets
* any unencrypted sensitive information can be learned by the attacker
* can use this to damage the organization or escalate their attack

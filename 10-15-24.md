# Cisco Device Security
## Line Level Security
### IOS Security
* When a cisco router or switch is received from the factory, no security is configured
* you can access the command line via console cable with no password required
* one of the first tasks is to configure security to ensure that only authorized administrators can access the device
### IOS Command Hierarchy
* hostname> - User Exec Mode
* hostname# - Privileged Exec mode ('enable')
* hostname(config)# - Global Configuration Mode ('configure terminal')
* hostname(config-if)# - Interface Configuration Mode ('interface x')
### Basic Line Level Security
* Minimal password security can be configured through the use of static, locally defined passwords at three different levels:
* Console Line - Accessing User Exec mode when connecting via console cable
* Virtual Terminal VTY - Accessing User Exec mode when connecting remotely via Telnet or SSH Secure Shell
* Privileged Exec Mode - entering the 'enable' command
* the levels can be used independently or in combination with each other
* can use the same or different passwords
### Basic Console Security
* Only one administrator can connect over a console cable at a time, so the line number is always 0
* `login` with no following keywords requires the administrator to enter the password configured at the line level to log in
* `line console 0`
* `password <password>`
* `login`
### Basic Telnet Security
* An administrator can use Telnet to connect to the CLI of a router or switch emotely over an IP connection
* IOS devices do not accept incoming telnet sessions by default
* an IP address and virtual terminal VTY line access must be configured
* Multiple administrators can connect at the same time. Lines are allocated on a first come first served basis
* if all configured lines are in use, then additional administrators will not be able to log in
* `line vty 0 15` configures all 16 terminal lines
* `password <password>`
* `login`
### Switch Management IP Access
* A layer 2 switch is not IP routing aware
* they do support a single IP address for management
* a default gateway also needs to be configured to allow connectivity to other subnets
* `interface vlan 1`
* `ip address 192.168.0.10 255.255.255.0`
* `no shutdown`
* `exit`
* `ip default-gateway 192.168.0.1`
### Exec Timeout
* An administrator will be logged out after 10 minutes of inactivity by default. This applies to both the console and VTY lines
* you can edit this value with the `exec-timeout` command
* `no exec-timeout` or `exec-timeout 0` will remove the timeout
### Securing VTY Lines with Access Lists
* You can apply an Access List to control access to your VTY lines
* this can be used to limit Telnet and SSH access to only your administrator workstations
## Privileged Exec and Password Encryption
* When you connect over the console or a VTY line, you will land at the user exec prompt which has a very limited set of commands available
* to get superuser access you use the 'enable' command to invoke privileged exec mode
* this can be secured with a password with `enable password <password>`
### Enable Password
* The enable password can be viewed in plain text in the running configuration by default. this can be a security concern
### Enable Secret
* the command `enable secret <password>` performs the same function
* when you use enable secret, it shows in an encrypted format in the running configuration
* if both an enable password and enable secret are configured, the enable secret supersedes the enable password
* best practice is to configure an enable secret but not an enable password
### Encrypting Passwords
* Line level passwords are also shown by default in plain text
* the `service password-encryption` command encrypts all passwords in the running config
* best practice to do this
### Usernames and Privilege Levels
* More granular security can be provided by configuring individual usernames and passwords for different administrators
* `username <username> secret <password>`
* at the line level config, enable `login local`
### Privilege Levels
* There are 16 privilege levels available on a cisco router or switch
* usernames can be assigned a privilege level. the default is 1
* you can also configuer different passwords for direct access to the different privilege levels
* each available command in IOS can be assigned a privilege level
* by default, three privilege levels are used, zero, user, and privileged
* zero-level access provides very limited read-only access to the router. When you enter user exec mode you're at privilege level 1 by default
* privileged level (level 15) provides complete control over the router. when you enter privileged exec mode with the enabel command, you're at level 15 by default
* when assigning usernames and passwords, you can add a privilege level before the password section
## SSH - Secure Shell
### Telnet vs SSH
* All tellnet communications cross the network in plain text
* if somebody sniffs the traffic using a tool such as wireshark, they can see al lthe commands you enter including your username and password
* all SSH traffic is encrypted
* if somebody sniffs your traffic, they can't read it
* best practice is to disable telnet and only allow SSH
### Enable SSH
* a digital certificate with a key length of at least 768 bits must be generated to enable SSH encryption
* `ip domain-name <name>`
* `crypto key generate rsa`
* use 768 or higher
### Disable Telnet
* VTY lines are used for both Telnet and SSH connections
* access is allowed for both by default
* a username is required for SSH access (line level passwords not supported)
* on line-level config, `transport input ssh`
* on global config you can limit SSH to v2 with `ip ssh version 2`
### AAA - Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
* Configuring line level security or local usernames on each device has a serious scalability limitation
* if a password has to be added, changed, or removed, it needs to be done on all devices
* an external AAA server can be used to centralize this instead
* multiple AAA servers can be implemented for redundancy
* Authentication verifies someone is who they say they are. this is most commonly achieved with a username and password
* Authorization specifices what a particular user is allowed to do, such as running a particular command
* Accounting keeps track of the actions a user has carried out - this is useful for fixing issues by undoing commands
* Authorization and Accounting are optional. Authentication is mandatory if authorization and/or accounting are used
### RADIUS and TACACS+
* The protocols used for AAA services are RADIUS and TACACS+
* both are open standards, although vendors may add their own proprietary extensions
* many vendor's AAA servers support both protocols
* RADIUS is better for user-level authentication (eg Remote Access VPNs)
* TACACS+ is better for granular authorization
### Cisco AAA Servers
* Cisco's AAA server is the Identity Services Engine (ISE)
* they also offered the Access Control Server (ACS) for a long time, but it is now end of sale
### How AAA works
* when you connect to the router, the router asks for username and password
* when you enter the username and password, the router forwards the credentials to the AAA server to verify
### Active Directory Integration
* the AAA server will send the username and password to the Active Directory controller
* this will then tell the AAA server whether the username or password is valid, as well as group information
* this allows for the AAA server to determine what commands are allowed to be run by that user, while still using Active Directory's single sign-on
## Global Security Best Practices
### Login and Exec Banners
* Messages can be displayed in the CLI before and/or after an administrator logs into a cisco device
* this is most commonly used to display security warnings
### Disable Unused Services
* best practice to disable unused services
* this reduces the attack surface, as well as the device load
* HTTPS is sometimes used by the GUI administration tools, but HTTP should be disabled
* CDP should also be disabled in highly secure environments
* `no idp http server`
* `no cdp run`
### Time Synchronization
* all servers and infrastructure devices in your network should be synchronized to the same time
* this aids in troubleshooting, as logs will report the correct time that events occurred
* it is also required by several security features, such as Kerberos authentication and digital certificates
### NTP Network Time protocol
* Servers and infrastructure devices can use their own internal clock, or synchronize with an external NTP server
* an NTP server should be used to ensure all devices have the same time
* a Cisco router can function as an NTP server and/or client
* `ntp server <ip address>` configures a router as an NTP client
* `ntp master` configures a router as an NTP server
* `show ntp status` to verify

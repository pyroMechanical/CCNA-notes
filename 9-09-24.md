# Inter-VLAN Routing
## Router with Separate Interfaces
### VLANS and IP subnets in the LAN
* There is typically a one-to-one relationship between an IP subnet and a VLAN in the LAN campus
* for example, Engineering hosts in subnet 10.10.10.0/24 and VLAN 10, the sales hosts are in IP subnet 10.10.20.0/24 and VLAN 20
* hosts are segregated at layer 3 by being in different IP subnets, and at layer 2 by being in different VLANs
* hosts in different IP subnets need to send traffic via a router to communicate with each other
### Option 1: Router with separate physical interfaces
* Router is connected via two separate interfaces, each on one of the VLANs
* router interface in each VLAN will be configured to act as the defaut gateway for that VLAN
* once you assign each interface its IP address, configure each interface on the switch side through `switchport mode access` and `switchport access vlan <id>`
### Option 1 Disadvantages
* you need a separate physical interface for each VLAN - you are liable to run out of interfaces
* traffic being routed within the campus has to go across physical cables to reach the router
## Option 2: Router on a Stick
* One physical interface reaching the router, with two virtual interfaces
* `interface f0/1.10` creates the sub-interface `f0/1.10`
* `interface f0/1`
* `no ip addr`
* `no shutdown`
* `interface f0/1.10`
* `encapsulation dot1q 10`
* `ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0`
* `interface fastethernet 0/1.20`
* `encapsulation dot1q 20`
* `ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0`
* `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2`
* on the switch, `interface f0/1` `switchport mode trunk`
### Considerations
* don't need a separate physical interface for every VLAN
* still being routed up and down the same physical cable
* more contention over bandwidth as multiple VLANs go over one cable
## Option 3: Layer 3 Switches
* layer 3 switches use a Switched Virtual Interface to perform routing between the VLANs
* internal traffic will never go to the router
* on switch:
* `ip routing`
* `interface vlan 10`
* `ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0`
* `interface vlan 20`
* `ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0`
* `interface fastEthernet0/1`
* `no switchport`
* `ip address 10.10.100.1 255.255.255.0`
* `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.100.2`
* on router:
* `interface fastEthernet 0/1`
* `ip address 10.10.100.2 255.255.255.0`
* `interface fastethernet 0/2`
* `ip address 203.0.113.1 255.255.255.0`
* `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2`
* `ip route 10.10.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.100.1`
### Option 3 Considerations
* Traffic being routed within the campus is now routed across the switch backplane, and does not need to travel over physical cables to an external router
* may still need an external router for WAN connectivity

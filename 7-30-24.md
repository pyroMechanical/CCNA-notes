# Routing Fundamentals
## Connected and Local Routes
### Two functions of a router
* determining the best path to available networks
* forwarding traffic to those networks
### Routing Tables
* the best available path or paths to a destination network are listed in a router's routing table
* these are used for forwarding traffic
* consists of directly connected networks, routes configured statically, and routes dynamically learned through a routing protocol
### Connected and Local Routes
* Administrator configures IP addresses on the router's interfaces
* `show ip route` shows routing table
* configured IP addresses are automatically entered to the routing table
* any traffic received on another interface  for a known route, will be sent out the connected interface
* from IOS 15 onward, local routes will also be added in routing table
* local routes always show as a /32 mask and show the IP address configured on the interface
## Static Routes
* if a router receives traffic for a network which it is not directly attached to, it needs to know how to get there in order to forward the traffic
* an administrator can manually add a static route to the destination, or the router can learn it dynamically via a routing protocol
* `ip route <network-ip> <subnet-mask> <device-ip>`
## Dynamic Routes
